You need to figure out where you are going, what route you will take, what you will need to bring with you, and what you will need to do when you get there. The same is true for cybersecurity. You need to figure out what systems you are protecting, what threats you are facing, what defenses you have in place, and what you need to do to protect your systems.	systems requirements planning	Explain systems requirements planning (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
System security analysis is like a doctor examining a patient. The doctor looks for any signs of illness and determines the best course of treatment. Similarly, a system security analyst looks for any signs of cyber-attacks and determines the best course of action to protect the system.	systems security analysis	Explain systems security analysis (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A system's security architecture can be thought of as a castle. The castle has walls to protect the inhabitants, a gate to control who enters and leaves, and towers to watch for potential threats. The security architecture of a computer system is similar. The computer system has a firewall to protect it from unauthorized access, antivirus software to protect it from malware, and a password to protect it from unauthorized users.	systems security architecture	Explain systems security architecture (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A tabletop exercise is like a game of chess. The players (the different parts of the organization) are all sitting around a table (the tabletop), and they are all looking at the same board (the exercise scenario). They are all making moves (taking actions), and they are all trying to achieve their goals (protecting the organization's assets).	tabletop exercise	Explain tabletop exercise (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A tailored trustworthy space (cybersecurity) analogy would be like a custom-made suit. It fits you perfectly and is made to your exact specifications. The suit is made from high-quality materials and is designed to last. It is also tailored to your specific needs, providing you with the protection you need against the elements.	tailored trustworthy space	Explain tailored trustworthy space (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A target in cybersecurity is like a bullseye on a dartboard. The closer you get to the bullseye, the more points you score. In the same way, the closer you get to a target in cybersecurity, the more points you score.	targets	Explain targets (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Technology research and development can be thought of as a process of searching for new and innovative ways to improve or enhance a technology. This may include improving the security of a technology by finding and addressing vulnerabilities.	technology research and development	Explain technology research and development (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Testing and evaluation (T&E) is like a fitness test for a soldier. The soldier goes through a battery of tests to see how fit they are and to find any areas that need improvement. The same is done for cybersecurity. T&E tests the security of systems and networks to find any vulnerabilities that could be exploited. It also helps to determine the effectiveness of security measures in place.	test and evaluation	Explain test and evaluation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity threat is like a robber breaking into your house. The robber can steal your possessions, damage your property, or even hurt you. A cybersecurity threat can do the same thing to your computer—steal your data, damage your computer, or even hurt you.	threat	Explain threat (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A threat actor is like a robber who breaks into a house to steal things. The robber is the threat actor, and the house is the computer. The things that the robber steals are the data that the hacker steals.	threat actor	Explain threat actor (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A threat agent is like a robber who breaks into your house to steal your belongings. The robber is the threat agent, and the belongings are the assets that are being targeted.	threat agent	Explain threat agent (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Threat analysis is like a detective investigating a crime. The detective gathers evidence and looks for clues to figure out who committed the crime and why. They also look for ways to prevent future crimes from happening. In the same way, threat analysts gather evidence and look for clues to figure out who is trying to hack into a system and why. They also look for ways to prevent future attacks from happening.	threat analysis	Explain threat analysis (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Threat assessment is like a doctor examining a patient. The doctor looks at the patient's symptoms and determines the best course of treatment. In the same way, cybersecurity professionals look at the symptoms of a cyberattack and determine the best course of action to protect the organization.	threat assessment	Explain threat assessment (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A ticket is like a key that unlocks a door. The ticket is a code that allows someone to access a specific area or resource. In cybersecurity, a ticket is like a password that allows someone to access a specific account or system.	ticket	Explain ticket (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A traffic light protocol is a cybersecurity measure that uses a traffic light metaphor to indicate the severity of a potential cyberattack. The colors green, yellow, and red represent different levels of severity, with green being the least severe and red being the most severe.	traffic light protocol	Explain traffic light protocol (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A trojan horse is a type of malware that is disguised as a legitimate program or file. When you install the program, the trojan horse is installed as well. It can then be used to steal your data or passwords, or to take control of your computer.	trojan horse	Explain trojan horse (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Unauthorized access can be best explained using an analogy. Imagine that you are a homeowner and you have a lock on your door. You give the key to your friend so that they can come into your house when you are not home. If someone else were to find the key and use it to come into your house, they would be accessing your home without authorization. This is similar to what happens when someone hacks into a computer system. They are accessing the system without authorization, which can result in damage or theft of information.	unauthorized access	Explain unauthorized access (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A virus is like a computer program that is designed to spread from one computer to another and to cause damage.	virus	Explain virus (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A vulnerability in cybersecurity is like a hole in a dam. If it is not fixed, water will flow through the hole and eventually cause the dam to break. Similarly, if a vulnerability in cybersecurity is not fixed, hackers can exploit it to gain access to your computer or network.	vulnerability	Explain vulnerability (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A vulnerability assessment is like a doctor checking a patient for potential health risks. The doctor looks for any red flags that could indicate a problem. If the doctor finds any potential issues, the patient is then evaluated to see if the risks are serious enough to require treatment.A vulnerability management program is like a hospital's emergency room. If the doctor finds a serious issue, the hospital's emergency room will be notified and will take steps to address the problem.	vulnerability assessment and management	Explain vulnerability assessment and management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Weaknesses in cybersecurity can be compared to a door that has not been properly secured. If an attacker knows the door is not locked, they can easily walk in and steal whatever they want. Similarly, if a hacker knows the username and password for a computer system, they can easily access the data stored on the system.	weakness	Explain weakness (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A white team is a group of people who are brought together to test the security of a system. They try to find vulnerabilities in the system and exploit them. They are also responsible for coming up with ways to protect the system from attack.	white team	Explain white team (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The work factor is the amount of time and effort it would take an attacker to break into a system. It is analogous to the amount of time and effort it would take a person to break into a house.	work factor	Explain work factor (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A worm is a type of malware that is designed to spread from computer to computer. It can do this by exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system or by using social engineering techniques to trick users into opening infected files or clicking on malicious links. Once it has infected a computer, the worm can spread to other machines on the network.	worm	Explain worm (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
