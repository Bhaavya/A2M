A trojan horse is a cybersecurity threat that is disguised as a legitimate program or file that is intended to be installed on a computer. The program may be used to gain access to the computer system or to steal information from the system.	trojan horse	What analogy is used to explain trojan horse (cybersecurity)?
Unauthorized access is like someone breaking into your house.	unauthorized access	What analogy is used to explain unauthorized access (cybersecurity)?
A virus is like a computer program that can attach itself to other programs and files on a computer, making them unusable. Just as a virus can harm a computer, a cyberattack can harm an organization’s computer systems, data, and employees.	virus	What analogy is used to explain virus (cybersecurity)?
A vulnerability is like a hole in a dam. It can be small or large, but if it is not fixed, the dam will eventually break.	vulnerability	What analogy is used to explain vulnerability (cybersecurity)?
A vulnerability assessment and management (cybersecurity) is like a doctor examining a patient for potential health risks. The doctor looks for any red flags that could indicate a problem, and then determines the best way to address the issue. Similarly, a vulnerability assessment and management (cybersecurity) program looks for any potential weaknesses in a network or system, and then determines the best way to fix them.	vulnerability assessment and management	What analogy is used to explain vulnerability assessment and management (cybersecurity)?
A company is like a fortress with walls, gates, and a moat. The company has strong defenses to protect it from intruders. However, if someone gets past the defenses and into the company, they can do a lot of damage. This is like a cyberattack where the intruder gets into the company's computer systems and steals or destroys data.	weakness	What analogy is used to explain weakness (cybersecurity)?
A white team is a group of people who are brought together to test the security of a system. They are given access to the system and are allowed to try to break into it. The goal of the white team is to find any vulnerabilities in the system and to report them to the system owner.	white team	What analogy is used to explain white team (cybersecurity)?
The work factor (cybersecurity) is often compared to the lock on a door. The higher the work factor, the more difficult it is to break into the system.	work factor	What analogy is used to explain work factor (cybersecurity)?
A worm is a type of malware that is designed to spread from computer to computer. It can do this by exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system or by using social engineering techniques to trick users into running it.	worm	What analogy is used to explain worm (cybersecurity)?
