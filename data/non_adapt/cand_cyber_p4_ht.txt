A lock and key analogy is used to explain access and identity management. The lock is the resource that needs protection, such as a computer or file cabinet. The key is the authentication credential, such as a username and password. Access control mechanisms use the key to unlock the protected resource only for those users who are authorized to access it.	access and identity management	What analogy is used to explain access and identity management (cybersecurity)?
The analogy of an onion is often used to explain access and identity management. The outer layer of the onion is the public-facing website or application, and each successive layer represents a higher level of security clearance. Only those with authorized access are permitted to view the inner layers of the onion.	access and identity management	What analogy is used to explain access and identity management (cybersecurity)?

An analogy to explain access and identity management is that it is like a key to a house. The owner of the house has the key and can give it to others who they trust, such as family or friends. These people can then come and go as they please by using the key. Access and identity management works in a similar way on a computer network. Administrators control who has access to which parts of the network by assigning permissions. Users must login with their username and password in order to gain access.	access and identity management	What analogy is used to explain access and identity management (cybersecurity)?
One analogy used to explain access control is that it is like locking your front door. You may have a lot of friends and family over, but you only want certain people to be able to enter your house. To do this, you might give some people a key while others must use the doorbell. In the same way, on a computer system, you might give some users permission to log in using a password while others must use an ID card or biometric data.	access control	What analogy is used to explain access control (cybersecurity)?

The analogy of a persistent threat is often compared to that of a weed. Weeds are known for being incredibly persistent and difficult to get rid of, and the same can be said for advanced persistent threats. These threats are notoriously hard to detect and even harder to remove, making them a major concern for businesses and organizations around the world.	advanced persistent threat	What analogy is used to explain advanced persistent threat (cybersecurity)?
A cyberattack is like a break-in at your house. You might not know it happened for a while, and when you do, the damage has been done.	advanced persistent threat	What analogy is used to explain advanced persistent threat (cybersecurity)?
Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are often compared to a bear. A black bear is relatively small, but it can be dangerous if you encounter one in the wild. Black bears can also be very persistent when they're hunting for food. They'll keep coming back until they catch their prey. Cybersecurity experts use this analogy to explain how APTs work. These attackers are like predators that are always looking for vulnerabilities to exploit. They may not be as big as some of the other threats out there, but they can cause a lot of damage if they're able to get into your system.	advanced persistent threat	What analogy is used to explain advanced persistent threat (cybersecurity)?
A cyberattack can be thought of as a burglary. Just as a thief would case a building before breaking in, attackers probe networks and systems for weaknesses so they can exploit them later. They may not cause any damage on their first attempt, but they’re always looking for new ways to get in – just like burglars who are constantly looking for new ways to break into homes.	advanced persistent threat	What analogy is used to explain advanced persistent threat (cybersecurity)?
A firewall is like a bouncer at a night club. It checks the ID of everyone who wants to get in, and only allows those who are on the list to enter. A firewall also monitors the activity inside the nightclub, making sure that everyone is following the rules.	adversary	What analogy is used to explain adversary (cybersecurity)?
One analogy used to explain adversary in cybersecurity is that of an opposing football team. Just as a football team may attempt to block, tackle, and otherwise hinder the other team in order to win, so too do cybercriminals seek to exploit vulnerabilities and steal information in order to achieve their goals.	adversary	What analogy is used to explain adversary (cybersecurity)?
-A cyber adversary is like a thief that breaks into a house to steal items.	adversary	What analogy is used to explain adversary (cybersecurity)?

Just like these barriers prevent people from physically entering or leaving an area, an air gap prevents unauthorized digital access to systems and data.	air gap	What analogy is used to explain air gap (cybersecurity)?
An analogy that is often used to explain alert (cybersecurity) is the early warning signs of a heart attack. Just as people experience different symptoms when they are having a heart attack, individuals will also experience different symptoms when their computer has been compromised. It is important for organizations to have an incident response plan in place so that they can quickly identify and respond to any potential cyber threats.	alert	What analogy is used to explain alert (cybersecurity)?
A possible analogy for being alerted of a cybersecurity incident is getting an emergency notification on your phone about a tornado warning in your area. Just as you would take necessary precautions to protect yourself and loved ones from the potential danger, you should also take steps to protect your digital assets when there is a heightened risk of cybercrime.	alert	What analogy is used to explain alert (cybersecurity)?
Alert (cybersecurity) can be compared to an air raid siren. They are both used as a warning to get people's attention and prepare them for what is coming next.	alert	What analogy is used to explain alert (cybersecurity)?
An analogy to explain alert can be using the example of a fire alarm. When the alarm goes off, it signals people in the building that there is a problem and they need to take action. A similar system is used in cybersecurity, where alerts are sent out when there is a potential threat so that users can take steps to protect themselves.	alert	What analogy is used to explain alert (cybersecurity)?
A cyberattack is like a burglar trying to break into your house. You may have a locking system on your doors and windows, or an alarm system, that will notify you of the attempted intrusion.	alert	What analogy is used to explain alert (cybersecurity)?
A firewall analogy is used to explain allowlist. A firewall analogy is a way of explaining how the allow list works by using an example of someone having a fire in their house. The person would put out the fire by using a bucket of water and they would block the flames from spreading by using a fence. In the same way, the computer's firewall uses a bucket of water (the deny list) to stop any malicious traffic from coming into your computer, and it uses the allow list to let through any traffic that is considered safe.	allowlist	What analogy is used to explain allowlist (cybersecurity)?
Allowing a user access to only the specific files and programs they need in order to do their job is similar to how allowing a user access to only the specific network ports they need in order to do their job is related to cybersecurity.	allowlist	What analogy is used to explain allowlist (cybersecurity)?
An analogy to explain allowlist would be a bouncer at a club. The bouncer is allowing certain people into the club, and not others. In cybersecurity, the allowlist is a list of approved IP addresses or domain names that are allowed access to a network or server.	allowlist	What analogy is used to explain allowlist (cybersecurity)?
Allowing specific IP addresses or domains into a firewall is similar to allowing only certain people inside of a building. You may have some friends that you always let in, but there are also other people that you only allow in under special circumstances. In the same way, you can control who has access to your computer systems by specifying which IP addresses or domain names are allowed through your firewall	allowlist	What analogy is used to explain allowlist (cybersecurity)?
An analogy used to explain allowlist is that it is like a bouncer at the door of a nightclub. The bouncer checks the identification of each person trying to enter the club and only allows those who are on the list (i.e., have been authorized) into the club. Similarly, in cybersecurity, an allowlist is a list of devices or users that have been authorized to access a network or system. Devices or users that are not on the list are not allowed access.	allowlist	What analogy is used to explain allowlist (cybersecurity)?

The moat is your defensive strategy and could include firewalls, antivirus software, host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS), data loss prevention (DLP) and other tools. The drawbridge is your authentication system that controls who has access to the network and what they can do while they’re on it.	asset	What analogy is used to explain asset (cybersecurity)?
Asymmetric cryptography is most commonly compared to a locked mailbox with two keys. One key is used to lock the mailbox and the other key is used to unlock the mailbox. The person who has the key that can unlock the mailbox (the private key) can also open it without anyone else being able to open it. The reverse is not true - if someone has the key that locks the mailbox, they cannot open it without using the other key.	asymmetric cryptography	What analogy is used to explain asymmetric cryptography (cybersecurity)?

Defenders must implement security measures to protect their systems and networks from these attacks.	attack	What analogy is used to explain attack (cybersecurity)?
The analogy used to explain attack (cybersecurity) is that of an iceberg. The vast majority of the iceberg is hidden below the surface, and only a small portion is visible. In the same way, most cyberattacks are not noticed by victims because the attackers use stealth techniques to avoid detection.	attack	What analogy is used to explain attack (cybersecurity)?
A cyberattack can be thought of as a home invasion. Just as an intruder would try to enter your home through a door or window, a hacker tries to gain access to your computer system through vulnerabilities in your software or network defenses.	attack	What analogy is used to explain attack (cybersecurity)?
A virus is like a cold. It's not pleasant, but it will usually go away on its own.	attack	What analogy is used to explain attack (cybersecurity)?
The analogy of an attack is often compared to a physical attack. Just as you would protect your home from burglars, you need to take steps to protect your computer and online information from thieves.	attack	What analogy is used to explain attack (cybersecurity)?
Hacking is like a break-in at your house. The burglar may try to force their way in through the front door, or they may try to find another way in, like a window. They'll also likely try different ways until they find one that works. In the same way, hackers will try different methods to get into your computer system until they find one that works.	attack method	What analogy is used to explain attack method (cybersecurity)?
A cyberattack can be thought of as the digital equivalent of a physical break-in. Just as thieves might use a crowbar to break a window or jimmy open a door, hackers use computer code to exploit vulnerabilities in software systems or networks.	attack method	What analogy is used to explain attack method (cybersecurity)?
Hacking is often described as "the act of breaking into a computer system." This analogy can be used to help understand other aspects of hacking as well. For example, just as someone who breaks into a building may do so by picking a lock or smashing a window, hackers gain access to systems by exploiting vulnerabilities or guessing passwords. Once they are in, they may take whatever steps they want, including stealing data, deleting files or crashing the system.	attack method	What analogy is used to explain attack method (cybersecurity)?
A cyberattack is like a home invasion. The attacker is looking for any opportunity to get into the system and take whatever information or assets they can find. Just like in a physical burglary, the attackers are hoping that you won't notice them until it's too late.	attack method	What analogy is used to explain attack method (cybersecurity)?
The analogy of Cybersecurity is that it is like a locked door. If someone wants to get into your house, they have to find the keyhole and unlock the door.

This allows them to identify potential weak spots and better protect themselves from possible threats.	attack mode	What analogy is used to explain attack mode (cybersecurity)?
Attack mode is like being in a football game. The offensive player has the ball and is trying to score touchdowns by running with the ball or passing it to another player. The defensive players are trying to stop the offensive player from scoring.	attack mode	What analogy is used to explain attack mode (cybersecurity)?
When in attack mode, a cybersecurity system is constantly on the lookout for threats. It monitors all network traffic and takes action when it detects something suspicious. This can include blocking or removing the offending files, shutting down the entire network, or notifying administrators so they can take further action.	attack mode	What analogy is used to explain attack mode (cybersecurity)?
Attacks on computer systems can be compared to the paths of cars and trucks on a highway. Just as there are many potential routes that vehicles can take, there are also many ways an attacker can try to break into or harm a computer system.

A firewall can be thought of as a series of concentric circles, with the innermost circle representing your computer or local network, and the outermost circle being the public internet. Anything that tries to enter your network from the internet must first pass through the firewall, which examines each packet for suspicious content.	attack path	What analogy is used to explain attack path (cybersecurity)?
A cyber security analogy to explain attack paths would be to liken it to a thief attempting to rob a home. The thief’s path of least resistance is likely to be the front door, as this is where they are most likely to find an unlocked door or window. However, if the thief encounters locked doors or windows along the way, they may have to try other means of entry, such as breaking a window or forcing open a door. In much the same way, hackers will look for vulnerabilities in networks and devices that can be exploited in order to gain access (the front door), but if they encounter barriers (locked doors/windows), they will often try alternative methods (breaking windows/forcing open doors).	attack path	What analogy is used to explain attack path (cybersecurity)?
The analogy used to explain attack path (cybersecurity) is that of a thief attempting to rob a store. The thief's path is composed of the steps he or she takes in order to enter the store, steal the merchandise, and exit the store. Similarly, an attacker's path through a network consists of the steps taken to gain access to systems and data, exploit vulnerabilities, and move around undetected. Figure 1 illustrates an example attack path.	attack path	What analogy is used to explain attack path (cybersecurity)?
A cyberattack can be thought of as a path that is created when an unauthorized user accesses and exploits a computer system or network. This path, also known as an attack vector, often starts with the use of malware, which is software designed to enable unauthorized access and control over a target system.	attack path	What analogy is used to explain attack path (cybersecurity)?
A possible analogy for attack patterns in cybersecurity would be comparing them to the way viruses spread in a human body. Just as different viruses can target different parts of the body and have unique methods of spreading, so too can different types of cyber-attacks exploit different vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks. Additionally, many attacks may use multiple techniques to achieve their objectives, similar to the way that a virus might use both direct infection tactics as well as more stealthy methods like hiding inside other files or processes.	attack pattern	What analogy is used to explain attack pattern (cybersecurity)?
One example of an attack pattern is a hacker scanning the internet for known vulnerabilities that they can exploit to gain access to systems or networks.	attack pattern	What analogy is used to explain attack pattern (cybersecurity)?

There are also defenses that can be put into place by the defender to help protect against these attacks.	attack pattern	What analogy is used to explain attack pattern (cybersecurity)?
A possible analogy for the way cyberattacks work could be to imagine a large group of people, armed with sticks, trying to break into a building. The attackers would first try to find an unguarded spot on the perimeter of the building, and then use their sticks to try and smash through the door or windows. Once inside, they would continue attacking until they reached their target (perhaps the safe in the office).	attack pattern	What analogy is used to explain attack pattern (cybersecurity)?
A common analogy used to explain attack patterns in cybersecurity is that of a wolfpack. Just as wolves travel and hunt in packs, cyber attackers work together in groups to exploit vulnerabilities and steal data.

Just like you might recognize someone's handwriting, computer security experts learn to look out for these patterns of attack so they can block them before they do damage.	attack signature	What analogy is used to explain attack signature (cybersecurity)?
An analogy to explain attack signature is that it is like a fingerprint. Just as each person has a unique fingerprint, each computer system has its own unique identifying characteristics which can be used to distinguish it from other systems. Attackers may use these signatures to identify vulnerable systems and launch attacks against them.	attack signature	What analogy is used to explain attack signature (cybersecurity)?
A cyber security analogy to attack signatures would be comparing them to the fingerprints of a person. Just as each person has unique fingerprints, every computer system or application has its own unique set of characteristics that can be used to identify it.

Cybersecurity is often described as a house of cards. Just one weak point can lead to the entire system being compromised.	authenticity	What analogy is used to explain authenticity (cybersecurity)?
Cybersecurity is often described as being similar to online banking. Just as you would not want someone else to have access to your bank account, you do not want someone else having access to your computer or information. You also want to be sure that the person who claims to be your bank is actually who they say they are. This is known as authentication, and it is one of the main goals of cybersecurity.	authenticity	What analogy is used to explain authenticity (cybersecurity)?
The analogy of an authorization is being like a bouncer at the door of a club. They are looking for people who are on the list and have been authorized to enter, and they are not letting anyone else in. Authorization is used in cybersecurity to make sure that only those people who are supposed to have access to certain systems or data are able to get in.	authorization	What analogy is used to explain authorization (cybersecurity)?

The firewall blocks access to certain parts of the network, just like a castle wall would block access to the people and resources inside the castle.	availability	What analogy is used to explain availability (cybersecurity)?
A lock is available for use when it is not in use by another person. It can be used again when the other person is done.	availability	What analogy is used to explain availability (cybersecurity)?
The availability of a cyber-infrastructure asset is like the water pressure in a city. Just as people need access to an adequate and consistent flow of water, they also need access to an adequate and consistent flow of data (and electricity). When the water pressure diminishes or disappears altogether, people are left with no means to bathe, cook or drink. The same is true for data – when its availability diminishes or disappears altogether, people are left without essential communication and commerce capabilities.	availability	What analogy is used to explain availability (cybersecurity)?
When you have a key to a house, it is available. When you publish your email address or phone number, it is available.	availability	What analogy is used to explain availability (cybersecurity)?
The analogy is used to explain that just as a homeowner would keep an eye on their property to look for suspicious activity, businesses and individuals should monitor their cybersecurity systems to look for any unusual or unauthorized behavior. By monitoring your system regularly, you can identify issues early and prevent them from becoming bigger problems.	behavior monitoring	What analogy is used to explain behavior monitoring (cybersecurity)?
A cyber security analogy to behavior monitoring would be like having a baby sitter watching your kids when you are at work. The baby sitter is looking for any signs that the kids are up to something they should not be doing, such as playing with matches or climbing on dangerous furniture. In the same way, behavior monitoring software is constantly watching your computer for any suspicious activity, such as trying to access restricted files or installing unauthorized software.	behavior monitoring	What analogy is used to explain behavior monitoring (cybersecurity)?
A comparison of computer security to the protection of a physical building can be made by looking at the three basic security strategies: prevention, detection, and response. Just as you would use a fence around your property to prevent people from entering without permission, you can use firewalls and antivirus software on your computer to prevent unauthorized access. Just as you would install motion detectors inside your home to detect intruders, you can use intrusion-detection systems on your network to detect unauthorized access attempts. And just as you would have a plan for what you would do if an intruder was discovered in your home, you should have a plan for responding to computer security incidents.	behavior monitoring	What analogy is used to explain behavior monitoring (cybersecurity)?
A behavior monitoring system is like a security guard that patrols the premises of a company. The guard keeps an eye out for any suspicious activity and reports it to the authorities. A behavior monitoring system does the same thing for your computer. It watches all of your activities and looks for anything that seems strange or out of place. If it finds something, it will report it to you so that you can take action.	behavior monitoring	What analogy is used to explain behavior monitoring (cybersecurity)?
An analogy used to explain behavior monitoring (cybersecurity) is that it is like having a security guard watching the door of a building.	behavior monitoring	What analogy is used to explain behavior monitoring (cybersecurity)?

A bot is a bit like a car. A car has different parts that work together to make it move. The engine, the wheels, and the steering all work together to allow the car to go where you want it to go. Bots also have different parts that work together to do what they are designed to do. The “brain” of the bot tells it what to do, how to respond when something happens, and where to go. The “body” of the bot contains all of the information about what needs done and how it should be done. And finally, just like with cars, bots need an instruction manual (or code) telling them exactly what they need to do in order for them to function properly	bot	What analogy is used to explain bot (cybersecurity)?
A bot is like a toddler. They are curious and want to explore their surroundings, but they also don't understand the dangers that can come with it.	bot	What analogy is used to explain bot (cybersecurity)?

A cyber breach is like a robber breaking into a house. The robber may be able to get in through a window, door, or chimney, but their ability to do damage will depend on what they find inside the home and how easily they can exploit any vulnerabilities they discover.	capability	What analogy is used to explain capability (cybersecurity)?
A cybersecurity analogy to explain capability would be if someone has a car, they can use it to go places. If they don't have a car, they can't go as many places; their capability is limited.

The same goes for businesses' cyber infrastructure: safeguarding against potential threats requires an integrated defense strategy involving multiple layers of security measures.	collect &amp; operate	What analogy is used to explain collect &amp; operate (cybersecurity)?
One analogy to explain the concept of collect and operate is that it is similar to a bank. The bank collects money from customers, then uses that money to operate by lending it out, investing in products, and so on. In the same way, a cybersecurity organization collects data from users, then uses that data to operate by analyzing it for threats, protecting against attacks, and more.	collect &amp; operate	What analogy is used to explain collect &amp; operate (cybersecurity)?
Analogy: Collect & Operate is like a farmer harvesting crops. The farmer collects the crops when they are ripe, and then operates on them to prepare them for sale or consumption.

In order to protect the city, you must know what the threats are and how best to counter them.	computer network defense analysis	What analogy is used to explain computer network defense analysis (cybersecurity)?
A computer network defense analysis is much like a city’s police force. The first line of defense are the officers who are out on patrol, and they are responsible for catching criminals in the act. If they can prevent crimes from happening, then there will be less work for them to do further down the line. However, if a crime does take place, then detectives will investigate what happened and try to track down the perpetrators. Just as with a city’s police force, having good detective work is critical to maintaining a strong security posture.	computer network defense analysis	What analogy is used to explain computer network defense analysis (cybersecurity)?

A possible analogy for consequence in cybersecurity is the use of seatbelts in cars. By wearing a seatbelt, an individual can reduce the severity of injuries sustained in a car accident. In the same way, by taking precautions like using strong passwords and installing software updates, individuals can minimize the damage done to their devices and data in the event of a cyberattack.	consequence	What analogy is used to explain consequence (cybersecurity)?
A possible analogy for understanding the consequences of inadequate cybersecurity is that of a homeowner who does not properly secure their home against burglars. If their home is burglarized, they may lose possessions that they value, such as jewelry or electronics. They may also have to spend time and money repairing any damage that was done during the burglary. In the worst case scenario, someone could be injured or killed if there was violence involved in the burglary. The same concepts apply to businesses when it comes to cybersecurity - if their systems are hacked, they may lose data (such as credit card information or Social Security numbers), suffer financial losses due to theft or ransomware payments, and experience negative publicity from being hacked.	consequence	What analogy is used to explain consequence (cybersecurity)?
A common analogy used to explain the consequences of insufficient cybersecurity is that of a house with no locks on its doors. If someone were to break into this house, they could steal whatever they wanted and there would be nothing the homeowners could do about it. In the same way, if a hacker breaks into a computer system, they can steal or damage data with little consequence.	consequence	What analogy is used to explain consequence (cybersecurity)?
If you don't lock your door, someone can walk into your house.	consequence	What analogy is used to explain consequence (cybersecurity)?

Cybersecurity is like having a personal bodyguard for your computer - someone who can help protect it from outside threats and keep it running smoothly.	customer service and technical support	What analogy is used to explain customer service and technical support (cybersecurity)?
The analogy of customer service and technical support is that they are both like a hospital. A hospital has many different areas that it specializes in, such as surgery, pediatrics, and psychiatry. However, the hospital also has generalists who can help with any area of healthcare. The same is true for customer service and technical support. Customer service typically specializes in resolving issues that are not related to technology, while technical support resolves issues that are related to technology. However, both customer service and technical support have staff who can help with any issue that arises.	customer service and technical support	What analogy is used to explain customer service and technical support (cybersecurity)?
It is often said that customer service is like a “balancing act.” The support technician must find the right balance between solving the customer’s problem and not doing too much or too little. It is also important to maintain this balance as new issues come in, so that everyone who calls gets treated fairly. Cybersecurity can be thought of in a similar way. Organizations need to find the right balance between protecting their networks and data and not implementing security measures that make it difficult for employees to do their jobs. They must also stay vigilant against new threats, while not becoming overwhelmed by them.	customer service and technical support	What analogy is used to explain customer service and technical support (cybersecurity)?

The use of analogy is often helpful when trying to understand complex topics. In the context of cybersecurity, one could think of computer networks as being akin to a city's water and power infrastructure. Just as cities rely on an intricate web of pipes and electrical cables to deliver essential resources, businesses and individuals rely on digital networks to transmit data and run critical applications. And just as it would be catastrophic for a city if its water or power systems were compromised by hackers, so too can a business be crippled if its network is hacked.	cybersecurity	What analogy is used to explain cybersecurity (cybersecurity)?
Cybersecurity is like locking your front door. You may have a strong lock on your door, but if you don't also use a deadbolt, someone can still get into your house. Cybersecurity is the same way - you need to have multiple layers of security in order to be protected from cyberattacks.	cybersecurity	What analogy is used to explain cybersecurity (cybersecurity)?

A company's Cybersecurity posture can be thought of as its "dynamic attack surface." Just as a physical building's attack surface expands and contracts based on how many people are in it, what doors and windows are open, and what type of security measures are in place, so too does a company's cyberattack surface. The more devices an organization connects to the internet—and the more vulnerabilities those devices have—the greater the potential for an attacker to gain access. Conversely, taking steps to secure vulnerable devices and close off unnecessary ports can help reduce a company's dynamic attack surface.	dynamic attack surface	What analogy is used to explain dynamic attack surface (cybersecurity)?
A cyber analogy to the real world is that of a castle with walls and gates. The wall is the perimeter defense, while the gate is the point of entry. Attackers will first try to breach the perimeter defenses by attacking the wall, but if they are unsuccessful they will try to gain entry through the gate. Just as in physical security, it is important to have strong perimeter defenses in order to deter attackers and minimize the damage if an attack does occur.	dynamic attack surface	What analogy is used to explain dynamic attack surface (cybersecurity)?
The analogy of a castle is often used when describing the dynamic attack surface. The walls of the castle are metaphorically the security perimeter, while everything inside the castle is considered to be safe from attack. However, if someone can penetrate the walls of the castle, they can gain access to everything within. Similarly, in order to protect against cyberattacks, organizations need to secure their perimeter and prevent unauthorized access to their systems and data. However, even with strong security measures in place, there is always a risk that an attacker will find a way to circumvent them and gain access to sensitive information.	dynamic attack surface	What analogy is used to explain dynamic attack surface (cybersecurity)?

A cyberattack is often like a hurricane. It may start with just a few people in the know, but it quickly gains strength and affects more and more people as it goes along.	impact	What analogy is used to explain impact (cybersecurity)?
A good analogy for the impact of cybersecurity is to think about it as being similar to a car. If you don't have proper maintenance and protection for your car, it will eventually break down, costing you more money in the long run. The same is true for your computer or network - if you don't have proper protection in place, your data will be at risk and could be stolen or corrupted.	impact	What analogy is used to explain impact (cybersecurity)?
Hitting a target with a projectile is similar to hacking an organization. The objective is to cause damage by penetrating the armor (defense) and striking the vulnerable part of the system.	impact	What analogy is used to explain impact (cybersecurity)?
Analogy of a cyberattack to an attack with a weapon:Just as an attacker can use a physical weapon to inflict damage on someone, so too can they use technology to launch attacks against computer systems and networks. Just as in the physical world, there are many different types of cyberattacks that can be launched, each with its own set of risks and consequences.	impact	What analogy is used to explain impact (cybersecurity)?
A good analogy for impact is the effect that a rock has when it is thrown into a body of water. The rock creates concentric circles that spread out from where it hit until they reach the edge of the water. In the same way, an attack on a computer can have a ripple effect as data and systems are compromised.	impact	What analogy is used to explain impact (cybersecurity)?

Just like you would not leave an crashed car on the side of the road, you should not ignore a cyber security incident.	incident response	What analogy is used to explain incident response (cybersecurity)?
Cybersecurity is often compared to firefighting. Just as firefighters must be ready to respond to a blaze at any time, cybersecurity professionals must also be prepared to deal with potential cyberattacks around the clock.	incident response	What analogy is used to explain incident response (cybersecurity)?
Laying out a fire hose to put out a house fire.	incident response	What analogy is used to explain incident response (cybersecurity)?
A cybersecurity incident response plan can be thought of as a fire drill.

A cybersecurity incident response plan is like a fire drill. Just as you would practice escaping a building in the event of a real fire, you should also have plans and procedures in place to deal with cyber incidents.	incident response plan	What analogy is used to explain incident response plan (cybersecurity)?
A good analogy for incident response planning is the way a fire department plans for and responds to fires. Just as there are different types of fires that need different responses, there are also different types of cybersecurity incidents that require different responses. The goal of an incident response plan is to have a set of procedures in place that can be followed when an incident occurs so that the organization can minimize the damage and protect its assets.	incident response plan	What analogy is used to explain incident response plan (cybersecurity)?
A fire alarm is a common example of an indicator. It is a signal that something potentially hazardous has occurred, such as a fire.	indicator	What analogy is used to explain indicator (cybersecurity)?

A thermometer is an example of an indicator. It measures the temperature and changes color to indicate whether it is hot or cold.	indicator	What analogy is used to explain indicator (cybersecurity)?
A control system analogy for industrial cybersecurity is a modern city’s traffic light network. A city’s traffic lights are controlled by computers that receive input from sensors in the road. The computer uses this data to determine when and how long to turn the traffic lights on green, yellow or red. If there is an issue with one of the sensors, it can cause all sorts of problems in the flow of traffic.	industrial control system	What analogy is used to explain industrial control system (cybersecurity)?
A cyberattack on an industrial control system is like a burglar breaking into a home.

If one part of the system is not working correctly, it can cause problems with the entire system.	industrial control system	What analogy is used to explain industrial control system (cybersecurity)?
The analogy of industrial control systems and cyber security is often compared to the human body. Just as the human body has many separate organs that must work together in order for the whole body to function, so too do Industrial Control Systems have multiple components that must interact seamlessly for operations to continue uninterrupted. If just one organ in the human body fails, it can cause serious health problems. The same is true for ICS cyber security; if even one component is compromised, it could lead to a potentially catastrophic event.	industrial control system	What analogy is used to explain industrial control system (cybersecurity)?

Compliance with information assurance (cybersecurity) requirements can be thought of as being like a car. Just as you would expect a car to have brakes, seat belts, and air bags, you should also expect your organization’s computing systems to have security features in place that protect them from unauthorized access or use.	information assurance compliance	What analogy is used to explain information assurance compliance (cybersecurity)?
The analogy of a ship in the sea is used to explain information assurance compliance. Just as a ship needs certain components (e.g., hull, rudder, propeller) to stay afloat and navigate through the water, organizations need certain components (e.g., policies and procedures, technical controls) to maintain their cybersecurity posture and protect their data.	information assurance compliance	What analogy is used to explain information assurance compliance (cybersecurity)?

A firewall analogy is used to explain information security policy (cybersecurity). A firewall analogy states that a firewall is like a barrier between two sections of a house. In the analogy, the section of the house with all of the important stuff is considered to be the internal network and the section of the house without any of the important stuff is considered to be the external network. The firewall analogy also states that just as you would not want people walking into your house through an open door, you do not want unauthorized people accessing your internal network.	information security policy	What analogy is used to explain information security policy (cybersecurity)?
The analogy to information security policy is that of a bank. Just as a bank has policies in place to protect its customers and their money, an organization needs to have policies in place to protect its computer systems and the data it stores.	information security policy	What analogy is used to explain information security policy (cybersecurity)?
A computer is like a library where people can go to borrow books. In the library, there are different sections with different kinds of books. The same thing happens on a computer; there are different folders (sections) with different types of files.	information sharing	What analogy is used to explain information sharing (cybersecurity)?
The analogy of a locked room with many keys is often used to explain information sharing in the cybersecurity context. Just as it would be foolish for someone to leave their door unlocked and all their valuable possessions inside when they go on vacation, it is also unwise for an organization to have a lack of cyber-defenses when criminals can easily find unprotected networks and steal sensitive data. By working together, businesses can create a “shared lexicon” that allows them to more effectively identify and protect themselves against potential threats.	information sharing	What analogy is used to explain information sharing (cybersecurity)?
The analogy of a locked house with valuable possessions inside is often used to explain information sharing. If the house is not locked, anyone can walk in and take whatever they want. However, if the house is locked and someone has the key, that person can share the key with others who they trust will not steal from them. In cybersecurity, this analogy would be like having a password for your computer that only you know. If you share this password with others, they could potentially access your computer without your permission.	information sharing	What analogy is used to explain information sharing (cybersecurity)?
An analogy to explain information sharing is when people are shopping in a store. If someone sees someone stealing they will usually tell the security guard. The security guard can then catch the thief and everyone in the store benefits from the thief being caught.	information sharing	What analogy is used to explain information sharing (cybersecurity)?
A lock and key analogy is used to explain information sharing (cybersecurity). A lock will not open without a key, and the key cannot be duplicated. In the same way, each company has its own specific cybersecurity operations that can only be accessed with a unique password or other security measure. By sharing this unique information with other companies, it helps build a stronger defense against cyber threats.	information sharing	What analogy is used to explain information sharing (cybersecurity)?
A cyberattack on an organization is similar to a fire breaking out in a building. The fire can damage the structure of the building, and it can also destroy the contents of the building.

A good analogy for information systems security operations is to think of it as a city. Just like there are different parts of a city that need to work together in order for the city to run smoothly (e.g., police, fire, sanitation, etc.), there are different parts of an organization's information technology infrastructure that need to work together in order for the organization's data and systems to be secure.	information systems security operations	What analogy is used to explain information systems security operations (cybersecurity)?
The analogy of cybersecurity is like a lock on your door. You may have the best lock in the world, but if you do not use it, then it does you no good. In the same way, you may have the best cybersecurity measures in place, but if someone can get into your system through a backdoor or by stealing your password, all of your security measures are for naught.	information systems security operations	What analogy is used to explain information systems security operations (cybersecurity)?
The analogy used to explain information systems security operations (cybersecurity) is that it is like a building’s security system.

The analogy of an iceberg is used to explain integrated risk management (cybersecurity). The visible part of the iceberg is what people see, and this is analogous to the organization's cyber defenses. The hidden part of the iceberg is what people do not see, and this is analogous to the vulnerabilities in the organization's systems. Just as a ship can be sunk by a small piece of ice above water, an organization can be crippled by a small vulnerability below the surface.	integrated risk management	What analogy is used to explain integrated risk management (cybersecurity)?
The analogy used to explain integrity (cybersecurity) is that it is the same as taking care of your personal belongings. Just like you would not leave your wallet or purse unguarded in a public place, you should also take precautions to protect your online information. This means using strong passwords, being aware of phishing scams, and installing security software on your devices.	integrity	What analogy is used to explain integrity (cybersecurity)?
A good analogy to integrity is the construction of a building. Just as a building must have a strong foundation to support its weight, data must be protected by strong security measures to ensure that it remains intact and confidential.	integrity	What analogy is used to explain integrity (cybersecurity)?
Integrity can be explained by using the analogy of a house. A house needs a foundation to stand on, and without it, the house will eventually crumble. In the same way, cybersecurity needs integrity to function properly; if there is no integrity, then the system will eventually fail.	integrity	What analogy is used to explain integrity (cybersecurity)?
The analogy for integrity is that it is like a bank deposit. If you make a deposit, you expect the bank to keep your money safe and not spend it on other things. The same is true of information when you send it over the Internet. You want to be sure that it will arrive at its destination safely and not be changed along the way.	integrity	What analogy is used to explain integrity (cybersecurity)?
Integrity is like a wall. It protects your data from unauthorized access and preserves its accuracy.	integrity	What analogy is used to explain integrity (cybersecurity)?

You may have locked your door, but if someone can easily walk in through an open window, they will be able to get into your house no matter how strong your lock is.	intent	What analogy is used to explain intent (cybersecurity)?
intent can be thought of as the cyber equivalent of a loaded gun. Just as with a physical weapon, if someone has intent to harm another person, they may use whatever means are available to them to do so – including cyber tools and techniques.	intent	What analogy is used to explain intent (cybersecurity)?
Just as different cars have different parts that need to work together to make the car run, so too do different computer systems have different parts that need to work together in order for the system to function.

Cybersecurity intrusion detection is similar to a smoke alarm. It is constantly on the lookout for suspicious activity, and when something arises, it quickly alerts you so that you can take action.	intrusion detection	What analogy is used to explain intrusion detection (cybersecurity)?
Cybersecurity intrusion detection is often compared to the body's natural ability to sense when something is not quite right. Just as the body has sensors that provide information about what is happening inside and outside of it, a cybersecurity system has devices called "intrusion detection systems" (IDS) that collect information about what is happening on the network. IDSs can be used to detect both malicious activity and unauthorized access.	intrusion detection	What analogy is used to explain intrusion detection (cybersecurity)?
The analogy of a physical security system is often used to explain intrusion detection in cybersecurity. Just as alarms sound when motion is detected in a building, intrusion detection systems (IDS) can be set up to send alerts when suspicious activity is noticed on a computer network. IDS can be configured to look for specific activities, such as repeated failed login attempts or the installation of new software programs.	intrusion detection	What analogy is used to explain intrusion detection (cybersecurity)?
A firewall is often compared to a bouncer at a nightclub. The bouncer checks IDs to make sure that everyone who enters the club is of legal age and then monitors the activities inside to ensure that no one gets too out of control. Similarly, a firewall helps protect your computer by blocking unauthorized access and monitoring traffic to detect suspicious activity.	intrusion detection	What analogy is used to explain intrusion detection (cybersecurity)?
Honeypots are often compared to the use of bait in animal trapping. Just as bait is used to lure an animal into a trap, honeypots are computer systems that are set up with vulnerabilities and configured to allow unauthorized access. Attackers who find these systems will attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities, thinking they have discovered an easy way into the network. While this may provide information about how attackers operate, it also allows defenders the opportunity to track their activities, learn their techniques, and identify any malicious software they may be using.	intrusion detection	What analogy is used to explain intrusion detection (cybersecurity)?
Investigating cybersecurity is similar to investigating a crime scene. Just as detectives collect evidence and try to piece together what happened, cybersecurity professionals do the same with digital information. They look for clues that could indicate a cyber attack, such as malware or strange network activity, and work to prevent future incidents.	investigate	What analogy is used to explain investigate (cybersecurity)?
You can think of investigating a cybersecurity incident as being similar to investigating a crime. Just as you would collect evidence at the scene of a crime and interview potential witnesses, you similarly need to gather evidence and speak with affected parties when responding to a cybersecurity incident.	investigate	What analogy is used to explain investigate (cybersecurity)?
Investigating (cybersecurity) is like investigating a crime scene. Just as detectives collect evidence and look for clues at a physical crime scene, cybersecurity analysts do the same in the digital world. They use forensic tools to search for malicious code, track hacker activity, and identify vulnerabilities. By understanding how criminals operate, they can develop strategies to protect networks and systems from attack.	investigate	What analogy is used to explain investigate (cybersecurity)?
Cybersecurity is like a locked door. The lock (cybersecurity) keeps people from getting into your computer, just like a locked door keeps people from getting into your house.	investigate	What analogy is used to explain investigate (cybersecurity)?
When someone is investigating a crime, they are looking for evidence to find out who committed the crime and what happened. Cybersecurity investigations work in the same way - investigators are looking for clues about who hacked into a system, what their motives were, and how they did it.	investigate	What analogy is used to explain investigate (cybersecurity)?
Cybersecurity can be thought of as a series of locked doors. Each door (or layer of security) can be unlocked by using the correct key (a password, for example). The goal of cybersecurity is to make it as difficult as possible for an unauthorized person to get through the doors and access your data.	investigation	What analogy is used to explain investigation (cybersecurity)?
Using a cyber analogy, an investigation is similar to forensic analysis of a computer system. Just as investigators can piece together evidence from a computer's hard drive in order to catch the perpetrator of a crime, so too can they use forensic techniques to analyze digital communications and networks in order to identify and track down malicious actors.	investigation	What analogy is used to explain investigation (cybersecurity)?
The cyber security investigation is like a puzzle. Just as with any other puzzle, different pieces need to be put together in order to get the big picture. The more pieces that are collected, the easier it becomes to see what the overall goal is and how each individual piece contributes.	investigation	What analogy is used to explain investigation (cybersecurity)?
One analogy used to explain investigation (cybersecurity) is that it is like a “crime scene”. Just as investigators comb through a physical crime scene for clues in order to identify the perpetrator, cybersecurity professionals do the same thing with digital data in order to find and stop cyber threats.	investigation	What analogy is used to explain investigation (cybersecurity)?
A common analogy used to explain investigation (cybersecurity) is that of a detective on a murder case. Just as the detective collects clues at the crime scene, analyzes them, and looks for patterns to solve the mystery, so too does a cybersecurity investigator do the same with data breaches and cyberattacks.	investigation	What analogy is used to explain investigation (cybersecurity)?
The analogy used to explain cybersecurity is that it is similar to having a fence around your house. It helps keeps you and your belongings safe from potential harm.	it asset	What analogy is used to explain it asset (cybersecurity)?
A cyber breach is like a thief breaking into your house. The burglar can steal your possessions, causing you financial harm. Similarly, a hacker can access your company's data and information, causing you financial harm.	it asset	What analogy is used to explain it asset (cybersecurity)?
In order to protect one's physical assets, one might buy a security system for their home. In the same way, companies and individuals buy cybersecurity software and services to protect their digital assets.	it asset	What analogy is used to explain it asset (cybersecurity)?
Asset (cybersecurity) is best explained using the analogy of a castle. Just as a castle needs walls, moats, and gates to protect those inside from harm, organizations need cybersecurity measures in place to protect their data and systems from unauthorized access or theft.	it asset	What analogy is used to explain it asset (cybersecurity)?
Cybersecurity is like a house. You have to have a strong foundation, good walls, a roof and windows to keep the weather out.	it asset	What analogy is used to explain it asset (cybersecurity)?
A lock is used to protect your house. The key is needed to open the lock and access what is inside. Cybersecurity is similar in that it uses different tools, such as passwords and firewalls, to protect your computer or network from unauthorized access.	key	What analogy is used to explain key (cybersecurity)?
Cybersecurity is a lot like locking your front door. You might not think about it until you need it, but if your house is unprotected, anyone could walk right in. The same goes for your computer – without proper security measures in place, anyone could access your files or steal your identity.	key	What analogy is used to explain key (cybersecurity)?
A lock is like a cybersecurity key. It is used to protect something important and it needs to be kept safe.	key	What analogy is used to explain key (cybersecurity)?
A lock on a door is an analogy for cybersecurity. Just as you would use a key to unlock a door, computer users need passwords and other authentication measures to access their data and networks.	key	What analogy is used to explain key (cybersecurity)?
A lock is a key.	key	What analogy is used to explain key (cybersecurity)?
A key pair is similar to a lock and key. The lock is the computer and the key is the password.	key pair	What analogy is used to explain key pair (cybersecurity)?
The key pair analogy is used to compare the security of a cyber system to that of a lock. Just as a key is needed to unlock a door, so too is a correct password necessary to gain access to a computer or network. The strength of the lock depends on the quality of the key, and vice versa; likewise, the security of a computer system is only as strong as its weakest password.	key pair	What analogy is used to explain key pair (cybersecurity)?
A key pair is used in cryptography to create a secure communication channel. The two keys are mathematically related, and one can be used to encrypt data while the other is used to decrypt it.	key pair	What analogy is used to explain key pair (cybersecurity)?
A key pair is a matched set of cryptographic keys, one public and one private. The keys are generated together and used to create a symmetric encryption key.	key pair	What analogy is used to explain key pair (cybersecurity)?
The analogy of key pair is that it is like a safe with two keys. One key is kept by the owner and the other is given to a friend. If either key is used, the safe can be opened.	key pair	What analogy is used to explain key pair (cybersecurity)?
A cyber breach is like a home invasion. Just as you would use locks, alarms and security cameras to protect your physical property, you need to use similar tools (firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems) to protect your digital property.	key resource	What analogy is used to explain key resource (cybersecurity)?
A good analogy for key resource cybersecurity is a safe. Just as you would want to protect your most valuable possessions by locking them away in a safe, you need to take the same precautions with your digital assets. A strong password, two-factor authentication and up-to-date software are all essential for keeping your data secure.	key resource	What analogy is used to explain key resource (cybersecurity)?
A key resource is something that is needed in order for a business to be successful. In the context of cybersecurity, this would be things like computer systems, software programs, and networks. These are all essential components of running a company and need to be protected from cyberattacks.	key resource	What analogy is used to explain key resource (cybersecurity)?
Cybersecurity is often compared to a "cyber pearl" in the ocean. Just as pearls are valuable and rare, so too are high-quality cybersecurity resources. Individuals, organizations, and governments must take care to protect these resources from unauthorized access and use.	key resource	What analogy is used to explain key resource (cybersecurity)?
A company that has a large warehouse of goods and materials is analogous to a business with strong cybersecurity. Just as the warehouses are critical for companies to protect their valuable resources, so too is cybersecurity important for businesses to safeguard their confidential data and systems.	key resource	What analogy is used to explain key resource (cybersecurity)?
Keylogger is like a burglary tool that records pressed keys on the keyboard.	keylogger	What analogy is used to explain keylogger (cybersecurity)?

Keylogger is a cyber security tool that is used to track or record all the keystrokes typed on a keyboard. It can be either software or hardware based.	keylogger	What analogy is used to explain keylogger (cybersecurity)?
Keyloggers are often described as being similar to a surveillance camera. Just as a security camera can record everything that happens in its view, a keylogger can record all the keystrokes made on the computer it is installed on.	keylogger	What analogy is used to explain keylogger (cybersecurity)?
Keyloggers can be thought of as locks for your computer. Just like you would use a lock to prevent unauthorized people from accessing your belongings, you can use a keylogger to prevent unauthorized people from accessing your computer and the information stored on it.	keylogger	What analogy is used to explain keylogger (cybersecurity)?
The knowledge management (cybersecurity) analogy is the use of a firewall. A firewall is a security system that is used to protect a computer or network from unauthorized access. The firewall blocks certain types of traffic from entering or leaving the network, while allowing other types of traffic through.	knowledge management	What analogy is used to explain knowledge management (cybersecurity)?
A knowledge management (cybersecurity) analogy using the game of golf is that it is like a never-ending journey. The farther you get down the fairway, the more potential there is for returning to previously visited holes. In addition, as your skills improve and new challenges are encountered, the game takes on a different complexion.	knowledge management	What analogy is used to explain knowledge management (cybersecurity)?
In order to understand knowledge management (cybersecurity), it is helpful to think of the process as being akin to a bank. The bank has numerous tellers, each with their own set of knowledge about how to handle different transactions. In order for customers to be able to successfully complete transactions, the bank needs a way to make sure that all of this individual knowledge can be accessed and used when needed. This is where the knowledge management system comes in - by compiling all of the relevant information into one place, it makes it easy for employees (or in our case, cyber defenders) to find what they need and use it effectively.	knowledge management	What analogy is used to explain knowledge management (cybersecurity)?
The analogy of a knowledge management system is often likened to that of a library. Just as books in a library are catalogued and shelved so that they can be easily found by anyone wishing to consult them, information within a KM system is also organised and indexed so it can be retrieved when required.	knowledge management	What analogy is used to explain knowledge management (cybersecurity)?
Knowledge management (cybersecurity) is often compared to a leaky bucket. The more information that is put into the bucket, the faster it will leak out. To prevent this, you need to be selective about what information goes into the bucket and make sure that it is properly secured.	knowledge management	What analogy is used to explain knowledge management (cybersecurity)?
A lawyer is often compared to a doctor. Just as patients go to their doctors for medical advice, clients seek legal advice from lawyers. Lawyers are not just advisors, but also advocates for their clients. They help protect their clients’ interests and guide them through the complex legal system.	legal advice and advocacy	What analogy is used to explain legal advice and advocacy (cybersecurity)?
One analogy to explain legal advice and advocacy (cybersecurity) is that it is like a doctor’s advice on keeping healthy. The lawyer gives guidance on how best to protect oneself from potential lawsuits or other legal problems, while the advocate helps represent your interests in court or with government agencies.	legal advice and advocacy	What analogy is used to explain legal advice and advocacy (cybersecurity)?
The analogy is that legal advice and advocacy (cybersecurity) are like firefighting. You want to put out the fires before they get too big.	legal advice and advocacy	What analogy is used to explain legal advice and advocacy (cybersecurity)?
Legal advise and advocacy is often compared to a cyber breach. Just as a company's cybersecurity team works to protect the company from outside threats, a law firm's legal team defends its clients by advocating for their interests inside of the courtroom or during settlement negotiations.	legal advice and advocacy	What analogy is used to explain legal advice and advocacy (cybersecurity)?
A legal analogy to cybersecurity would be the advice a doctor gives to a patient. The doctor's job is to provide advice and advocate for the best interests of their patients. Similarly, cybersecurity professionals must provide advice and advocate for the best interests of their clients or organizations. This may include helping businesses protect their networks and data from cyber threats, working with law enforcement agencies when attacks occur, or assisting individuals in recovering from a cyber incident.	legal advice and advocacy	What analogy is used to explain legal advice and advocacy (cybersecurity)?
The analogy is that machine learning and evolution (cybersecurity) are both processes of adaptation. Machine learning is a process where computers learn from data, and evolution is a process where organisms adapt to their environment.	machine learning and evolution	What analogy is used to explain machine learning and evolution (cybersecurity)?
The analogy of machine learning and evolution is that they are both processes that allow something to change over time. With machine learning, the algorithm is able to improve its performance as it receives more data. With evolution, organisms are able to adapt and survive in new environments as they reproduce. In cybersecurity, this analogy can be used to explain how attackers learn from their mistakes and how defenders can evolve their defences to keep up.	machine learning and evolution	What analogy is used to explain machine learning and evolution (cybersecurity)?
Analogy: Machine learning and evolution (cybersecurity) are both processes that allow something to change over time in a way that makes it better suited to its environment. With machine learning, a computer system is able to learn on its own by analyzing data. It then uses this information to make predictions or decisions in the future. With evolution (cybersecurity), malware is able to adapt and evolve over time so that it becomes harder for security systems to detect and block it.	machine learning and evolution	What analogy is used to explain machine learning and evolution (cybersecurity)?
One analogy used to explain machine learning and evolution (cybersecurity) is that of an immune system. The immune system protects the body from disease by learning what pathogens it is exposed to and then developing defenses against them. In a similar way, machine learning systems can learn the patterns of malicious activity on a network and develop defenses against them.	machine learning and evolution	What analogy is used to explain machine learning and evolution (cybersecurity)?
Cybersecurity is often compared to the process of evolution. Just as organisms evolve over time in response to selective pressures, cybersecurity defenses likewise must adapt to survive and thrive in a constantly changing digital environment. Machine learning is one means by which this adaptation can occur, as it allows systems to learn and improve their defensive capabilities on their own without human input.	machine learning and evolution	What analogy is used to explain machine learning and evolution (cybersecurity)?
A macro virus is a type of computer virus that spreads by embedding itself into documents or other files. Macro viruses are written in the same language as the application in which they will spread, such as Microsoft Word or Excel.	macro virus	What analogy is used to explain macro virus (cybersecurity)?
A macro virus is a type of computer virus that is written in the same language as a document or spreadsheet. This allows the virus to be embedded within the document or spreadsheet, and it can then be run when the document or spreadsheet is opened.	macro virus	What analogy is used to explain macro virus (cybersecurity)?
A macro virus is like a cold or the flu. It's a type of infection that can spread quickly and easily, and it can be difficult to get rid of. Just like with a cold or the flu, you need to take steps to protect yourself from getting infected, and you also need to take steps to recover if you do get infected.	macro virus	What analogy is used to explain macro virus (cybersecurity)?
A macro virus is like a computer program that can run automatically when you open an infected document.	macro virus	What analogy is used to explain macro virus (cybersecurity)?
A macro virus is like a flu virus. Just as the flu virus spreads through contact with other people, a macro virus can spread through contact with infected files.	macro virus	What analogy is used to explain macro virus (cybersecurity)?
A malicious applet is a cyber security threat that is similar to a computer virus. Just as a virus can infect a computer and cause it to perform unauthorized tasks, a malicious applet can do the same thing to an unsuspecting user's web browser.	malicious applet	What analogy is used to explain malicious applet (cybersecurity)?
Malicious applet can be compared to a virus. Just as a virus can spread throughout an infected computer, compromising data and programs, a malicious applet can do the same thing when it is run on a user's system.	malicious applet	What analogy is used to explain malicious applet (cybersecurity)?
Malicious applets are computer programs that are designed to harm the user of the device on which they are installed. They can be used to steal information, destroy data, or simply cause annoyance to the user. An example of a malicious applet would be a virus or worm.	malicious applet	What analogy is used to explain malicious applet (cybersecurity)?
A malicious applet is like a virus. It is a small program that can be inserted into other programs to cause damage or steal information.	malicious applet	What analogy is used to explain malicious applet (cybersecurity)?

Just like a virus, malicious code can be unintentionally downloaded or installed on devices, which can then lead to data loss or other security issues.	malicious code	What analogy is used to explain malicious code (cybersecurity)?
Malicious code is often compared to a virus, as it can similarly spread and infect systems.	malicious code	What analogy is used to explain malicious code (cybersecurity)?
Malicious code can be compared to a virus. Just like a virus spreads through the body and causes sickness, malicious code can spread through a computer system and cause damage or harm.	malicious code	What analogy is used to explain malicious code (cybersecurity)?
A malicious code is like a virus. It can infect your computer and spread to other computers on the network.	malicious code	What analogy is used to explain malicious code (cybersecurity)?
Malicious logic, or cyberattacks, can be thought of as computer viruses. Just as a virus can infect a computer and cause it to malfunction, a cyberattack can exploit vulnerabilities in software to damage or steal data. Like a physical virus, malicious logic can be transmitted through email attachments, downloads, and social media links. It can also spread through networks of computers that are interconnected	malicious logic	What analogy is used to explain malicious logic (cybersecurity)?
Malicious logic is often compared to a "cyberattack", in which an unauthorized user tries to gain access to a computer system or network. Just as a cyberattacker might use malicious code or software to try and break into a system, a hacker might use malicious logic to try and exploit vulnerabilities in software or hardware.	malicious logic	What analogy is used to explain malicious logic (cybersecurity)?
Malicious logic can be best explained by using the analogy of a thief. A thief is someone who uses deceitful methods to gain unauthorized access to something they are not supposed to have access to, such as personal belongings or money. Similarly, malicious logic is used when hackers use deceitful methods to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and data.	malicious logic	What analogy is used to explain malicious logic (cybersecurity)?
Malicious logic (cybersecurity) is often likened to a virus or Trojan horse. Just as a virus can infect a computer and wreak havoc, malware can exploit vulnerabilities in software programs and networks to steal data or damage systems.	malicious logic	What analogy is used to explain malicious logic (cybersecurity)?
Malicious logic can be compared to a virus. Just as a virus can infect a computer and cause it to malfunction, malware (malicious software) can infect a network or system and wreak havoc. Malware is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in order to gain access to systems or data, steal information, install ransomware, or damage the system.	malicious logic	What analogy is used to explain malicious logic (cybersecurity)?
Malware is often described as a "bug" or "virus." These analogies are used to help people understand that just as diseases spread and can be harmful, malware can do the same.	malware	What analogy is used to explain malware (cybersecurity)?
Malware (cybersecurity) is often compared to a virus. Just as a virus can infect and harm the body, malware can infect and harm a computer system.	malware	What analogy is used to explain malware (cybersecurity)?
Malware is often compared to a virus, as both are able to spread and infect systems. However, malware can also be thought of as a type of computer program that performs malicious actions, such as stealing data or logging keystrokes.	malware	What analogy is used to explain malware (cybersecurity)?
Malware is often compared to a virus, as they share many similarities. Just like how a virus can infect your computer and make it sick, malware can do the same thing but with your internet-connected devices. Malware can also spread from one device to another very quickly, just like a virus.	malware	What analogy is used to explain malware (cybersecurity)?
Malware is often compared to a computer virus, as both are pieces of software that can cause harm to a computer system.	malware	What analogy is used to explain malware (cybersecurity)?
A company may have a policy of never sharing passwords, but if an employee's password is compromised, the company can mitigate the damage by implementing two-factor authentication or requiring users to change their passwords.	mitigation	What analogy is used to explain mitigation (cybersecurity)?
A mitigating factor is something that reduces the severity of a potential harmful event. For example, in cybersecurity, a user might have two-factor authentication enabled on their account, which would be a mitigating factor if their credentials were compromised.	mitigation	What analogy is used to explain mitigation (cybersecurity)?
A good analogy for mitigation is using a seat belt while driving. The seat belt is not 100% effective at preventing injury in the event of an accident, but it does increase the chances that you will survive the crash. In much the same way, implementing security measures like firewalls and antivirus software can help to reduce the likelihood of cyberattacks succeeding and causing damage.	mitigation	What analogy is used to explain mitigation (cybersecurity)?
A good analogy for mitigation is that of locking your car. Even if someone has the key to your car, they cannot drive it without the proper authorization (e.g., a driver’s license). In the same way, you can lock down your computer systems to prevent unauthorized access, even if an attacker has compromised one of your systems.	mitigation	What analogy is used to explain mitigation (cybersecurity)?
Mitigation is often compared to repairing a home’s roof during a rainstorm. The goal is to fix the problem before it becomes too large and causes further damage.	mitigation	What analogy is used to explain mitigation (cybersecurity)?
A moving target defense (cybersecurity) analogy is used to explain how traditional security products and strategies can be ineffective against modern cyber threats. The analogy compares the static defenses of a castle with the constantly moving targets of a battlefield. Just as medieval castles were vulnerable to new siege technologies, current computer networks are susceptible to attacks from hackers who employ novel methods and tools. To stay ahead of these threats, organizations must continuously update their security posture by incorporating new safeguards such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and anti-virus software.	moving target defense	What analogy is used to explain moving target defense (cybersecurity)?
Hitting a moving target is more difficult than hitting a stationary one. Defense against cyber threats is like trying to hit a moving target - it's difficult and constantly changing.	moving target defense	What analogy is used to explain moving target defense (cybersecurity)?
A moving target defense is similar to how a military defends against an attack. The military will constantly move their troops and equipment around so the enemy can't predict where they will be next, making it difficult for the enemy to plan an attack. In cybersecurity, organizations use the same tactic by constantly changing their passwords, security mechanisms, and other defenses so that attackers can't find a pattern and plan an attack.	moving target defense	What analogy is used to explain moving target defense (cybersecurity)?
A moving target defense (cybersecurity) analogy is used to compare it to a hunter who must continually move around in order to avoid being captured by the prey. In the same way, a business must keep their cybersecurity strategy updated and changing in order to stay ahead of potential cyber threats.	moving target defense	What analogy is used to explain moving target defense (cybersecurity)?
A good analogy for MTD is the use of a shield by a medieval knight. The shield not only protects the knight from incoming attacks, but also provides him with an opportunity to attack his enemies. In much the same way, MTD allows organizations to protect themselves from cyberattacks while also providing them with the ability to launch their own countermeasures.	moving target defense	What analogy is used to explain moving target defense (cybersecurity)?
A cyber security analogy that is often used to describe network resilience is the “seven layers of defense” model. This analogy compares a computer networks security defenses to the seven levels of protection in the United States Department of Defense's (DoD) Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) strategy. The first level of defense is seen as the outermost perimeter of the network, while the seventh and final layer represents measures that are taken after an attack has already occurred.	network resilience	What analogy is used to explain network resilience (cybersecurity)?
One analogy for network resilience is the human body. Our bodies have many different organs that work together to keep us alive. If one organ fails, our other organs can compensate. The same is true for networks. If one part of the network fails, other parts can compensate. This makes the network more resilient and less likely to fail completely.	network resilience	What analogy is used to explain network resilience (cybersecurity)?
A cyber security analogy to network resilience would be firefighters preparing for and responding to a city-wide emergency. Just as the firefighters have plans and protocols in place to deal with any potential emergency, the cyber security team has measures in place to protect the network from attack and ensure business continuity in the event of an incident. The cyber security team also monitors the network constantly for signs of an attack so that they can respond quickly if one occurs.	network resilience	What analogy is used to explain network resilience (cybersecurity)?
A network is like a city. Just as cities have emergency plans in place to deal with disasters, networks need resilience protocols to handle unexpected events, such as cyberattacks.	network resilience	What analogy is used to explain network resilience (cybersecurity)?
A network is like a group of people who are connected by relationships. If one person in the group is sick, it affects the rest of the group. However, if there are enough people in the group, then someone can always fill in for the sick person and the group remains strong.	network resilience	What analogy is used to explain network resilience (cybersecurity)?
Just as the power grid provides electricity to our homes and businesses, a network service provider (NSP) provides connectivity to devices on their network. Just as we need access to the power grid in order to use our appliances, we need access to networks in order to use our connected devices.	network services	What analogy is used to explain network services (cybersecurity)?
A network service is something like a restaurant. It has a physical location where people can go to get food, but it also has an online presence where people can order food to be delivered. The online presence is what allows the restaurant to reach more customers than it could if it were only serving people who came in person. Similarly, a cybersecurity company can provide services to more customers by offering them online.	network services	What analogy is used to explain network services (cybersecurity)?
The analogy of a network service is similar to that of a utility, like water or electricity. Just as you would expect your local utility company to keep the lights on and the water flowing, you should expect your network service provider (NSP) to protect your organization’s networks and data from cyber threats.	network services	What analogy is used to explain network services (cybersecurity)?
A network is like a town. Just as the people in a town need water, police protection, and firefighting services, the computers on a network need security, backup, and other services.	network services	What analogy is used to explain network services (cybersecurity)?
A network service is like a utility, such as water or electricity. Just as you would not want your water supply to be easily accessible to everyone in the neighborhood, you do not want your computer systems and data readily available to anyone on the internet. You need to have some way of protecting your systems from unauthorized access and use. This is where cybersecurity comes in.	network services	What analogy is used to explain network services (cybersecurity)?
A non-repudiation service provides evidence that a message has been sent and received, preventing either the sender or receiver from later denying they were involved. It is similar to sending a registered letter through the mail – both the sender and receiver receive confirmation that the letter was delivered.	non-repudiation	What analogy is used to explain non-repudiation (cybersecurity)?
A non-repudiation service provides evidence of the sending and receiving of a message, as well as the time it was sent. This can be used to prove that a message was not altered in transit or that it came from a specific sender.	non-repudiation	What analogy is used to explain non-repudiation (cybersecurity)?
The analogy of a signature on a contract is often used to explain non-repudiation in the context of cybersecurity. A signature provides assurance that the person who signed the contract did so willingly and is therefore obligated by the contract. In a similar way, digital signatures provide an authentication mechanism for data or messages, ensuring that the data was not tampered with during transmission and that it originated from where it is claimed to have come from.	non-repudiation	What analogy is used to explain non-repudiation (cybersecurity)?
Non-repudiation is like a signature on a check. It proves that the person who signed the check actually did so. In the same way, non-repudiation in cybersecurity proves that the person who sent or received the message was actually the one who did so.	non-repudiation	What analogy is used to explain non-repudiation (cybersecurity)?
The analogy used to explain non-repudiation is that of a hand shake. Just as a handshake assures both parties that the agreement has been made, non-repudiation in cybersecurity ensures that an agreement or communication has taken place and that it cannot be denied by either party.	non-repudiation	What analogy is used to explain non-repudiation (cybersecurity)?
A firewall analogy is used to help explain cybersecurity. A firewall can be thought of as a barrier between your computer and the Internet. It helps to keep unauthorized users from accessing your computer and stealing your data. Cybersecurity can be thought of as a similar barrier, protecting your computer and its data from unauthorized access by hackers or other cybercriminals.	object	What analogy is used to explain object (cybersecurity)?
A good analogy for cybersecurity is a lock on your door. Locks can be used to protect your home from intruders, and cybersecurity can be used to protect your computer from unauthorized access.	object	What analogy is used to explain object (cybersecurity)?
The cybersecurity analogy is a firewall. A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls the traffic between networks. It can be used to protect one network from another, or to protect individual computers on a network from unauthorized access.	object	What analogy is used to explain object (cybersecurity)?
A cyber security analogy can be made to the locks on your front door. Just as you use a key to unlock your door, computer hackers use special codes to break into networks and steal data. Cybersecurity solutions are like different types of locks that can protect your information from these attacks.	object	What analogy is used to explain object (cybersecurity)?
The analogy of a castle is used to explain object (cybersecurity). Just as a castle has walls and gates to protect the people inside, cybersecurity has barriers like firewalls and passwords to protect data.	object	What analogy is used to explain object (cybersecurity)?
A cyber security analogy that is often used is to think of your computer or network as a car. Just like you have to maintain and operate your car in order for it to run smoothly, you also have to do the same for your computer or network. This means regularly updating software, installing patches, and using anti-virus software.	operate &amp; maintain	What analogy is used to explain operate &amp; maintain (cybersecurity)?
Operate & maintain (cybersecurity) is like maintaining a car.

Plaintext is like a letter that is written on paper and sent through the mail. The sender encrypts the message by using a code, such as cipher text. The recipient uses the same code to decrypt the message.	plaintext	What analogy is used to explain plaintext (cybersecurity)?
A good analogy to describe plaintext (and cryptography in general) is the security of a post office box. The postal service has a master key that can unlock any individual post office box, but the key is not known to anyone except for the postal service. If someone wanted to send a letter to someone's post office box, they would need to know the specific combination to unlock the lock on the box. Similarly, when you send an email, your message is encrypted using a specific algorithm and a secret key. That encrypted message is then sent over the internet as plaintext (unencrypted). When it arrives at the recipient's mailbox, their mail server will use their private key to decrypt the message.	plaintext	What analogy is used to explain plaintext (cybersecurity)?

In this analogy, the computer system can be thought of as the organization's networks and systems, and the malware can be thought of as the security incident. Just as with a computer system that has been infected with malware, an organization's networks and systems will also need to be restored following a security incident. This means restoring all data that was lost or damaged during the incident, repairing any damage that was done to networks or systems, and installing any patches or updates that are needed to secure them against future attacks.	recovery	What analogy is used to explain recovery (cybersecurity)?
The analogy is used to explain that red team members act as the "enemy" and try to hack into the systems being tested just as a real hacker would. This allows organizations to find vulnerabilities before someone else does.	red team	What analogy is used to explain red team (cybersecurity)?
Red team is the military term for a unit that attacks an opposing force, or in this case, infiltrates and attempts to penetrate the networks of other organizations.	red team	What analogy is used to explain red team (cybersecurity)?
A red team analogy is often used in the cybersecurity industry to help explain the concept of penetration testing.

The goal of the red team is to help the company strengthen their cybersecurity defenses by identifying and fixing any potential holes that could be exploited by hackers.	red team	What analogy is used to explain red team (cybersecurity)?
A red team exercise is a cybersecurity tactic where an organization pits its employees against a group of professional hackers hired by the company to try and penetrate its systems. The aim of the red team is to improve the defensive capabilities of the target by identifying and plugging security holes before malicious actors can exploit them.The best way to think about a red team exercise is as a real-life game of “capture the flag”. Just like in the classic strategy game, each side has a flag that they are trying to protect, and the objective is to capture or destroy the other team’s flag while preventing your own from being taken. In a red team exercise, instead of flags, you have computer systems with valuable data that need protecting. And just like in “capture the flag”, your goal is to infiltrate your opponent’s systems while keeping yours secure.	red team exercise	What analogy is used to explain red team exercise (cybersecurity)?
A red team exercise is akin to a military simulation in which one force, the Red Team, tries to breach the security of another force, the Blue Team.

This means having multiple layers of protection, such as firewalls, antivirus software and intrusion detection systems.	redundancy	What analogy is used to explain redundancy (cybersecurity)?
Redundancy is similar to having multiple backups of your computer files. If one file gets deleted or corrupted, you have other copies of the same file to fall back on. In cybersecurity, redundancy means having multiple security measures in place in case one measure fails. For example, you might have a firewall and anti-virus software installed on your computer, as well as a backup plan in case your computer gets hacked.	redundancy	What analogy is used to explain redundancy (cybersecurity)?
Cybersecurity is often explained using the analogy of a car. Just as you have brakes on your car in case one fails, you need multiple layers of security in case one layer fails.	redundancy	What analogy is used to explain redundancy (cybersecurity)?

In the same way, if one cybersecurity measure is defeated, an attacker can gain access to your system. To prevent this from happening, you need multiple layers of security in place, each of which acts as a leg of the stool.	redundancy	What analogy is used to explain redundancy (cybersecurity)?
Redundancy is often compared to a three-legged stool. If you remove one leg, the stool will still stand because it has two other legs. In the same way, if you lose one computer in your network, the rest of the computers can still function because they have redundancy.	redundancy	What analogy is used to explain redundancy (cybersecurity)?
A city that has been attacked by a ransomware virus is like a person who has been punched in the face. The first time, they may be knocked down and feel the pain for some time afterwards. However, if they are resilient, they will get back up and continue on with their life. A city that has been repeatedly attacked by ransomware viruses is like a person who has been punched in the face multiple times. They will start to wear down and may not be able to recover as easily as someone who has only been hit once.	resilience	What analogy is used to explain resilience (cybersecurity)?
A rubber band is stretched and then released. It quickly returns to its original shape.	resilience	What analogy is used to explain resilience (cybersecurity)?

Locks can be used on doors, windows, and other entry points to a building in order to provide an extra layer of security for the people inside. Similarly, cybersecurity can be used on software applications in order to protect the data that is stored within them from unauthorized access.	software assurance	What analogy is used to explain software assurance (cybersecurity)?
Cybersecurity is like having a locked door on your house. It's the first layer of security that you have to protect yourself from someone breaking in. However, if someone has a key to your house, they can still get in, no matter how many locks are on your door.	software assurance	What analogy is used to explain software assurance (cybersecurity)?
Software assurance (cybersecurity) is like having a fence around your house. It's not 100% foolproof, but it will deter most people from trying to break in, and if someone does manage to get past the fence, you have other security measures in place to catch them.	software assurance	What analogy is used to explain software assurance (cybersecurity)?
Software assurance can be thought of as a form of insurance. Just as you would purchase car insurance to financially protect yourself in the event that your car is damaged, software assurance protects your computer systems and data in case they are compromised by malware or other cyber threats.	software assurance	What analogy is used to explain software assurance (cybersecurity)?
Software assurance and security engineering can be thought of as locks on your doors and windows. Locks provide a means to secure your possessions by preventing unauthorized access, but they alone cannot guarantee security. You must also use other methods such as alarms, cameras, and motion detectors to create a comprehensive security system. The same is true for software: while security controls (like passwords) can help protect against unauthorized access, they are not foolproof. Security engineering involves incorporating a variety of techniques into the software development process in order to produce more secure software.	software assurance and security engineering	What analogy is used to explain software assurance and security engineering (cybersecurity)?
Cybersecurity is often explained using the analogy of locks and keys. Just as you need a key to unlock a door, you need the correct security measures (e.g., passwords, firewalls) to unlock your data. Without proper security measures in place, your information is at risk for theft or damage.	software assurance and security engineering	What analogy is used to explain software assurance and security engineering (cybersecurity)?
Software assurance and security engineering can be thought of as locks on a door. The locks are there to ensure that only authorized people can get into the room (or in this case, access the data). Security engineering is the process of designing and building those locks, while software assurance is making sure they are used correctly.	software assurance and security engineering	What analogy is used to explain software assurance and security engineering (cybersecurity)?
Software assurance is like a car. Just as you need to have a reliable car to get from point A to point B, you need software that is assured and secure to do business.

A firewall analogy is used to explain systems security architecture (cybersecurity). The firewall analogy uses the image of a building with walls and windows. The purpose of the walls is to protect the people inside from outsiders, and the purpose of the windows is to allow people inside to see out. In the same way, a firewall protects a computer system from unauthorized access from the Internet, while still allowing authorized users to access information on the Internet.	systems security architecture	What analogy is used to explain systems security architecture (cybersecurity)?
A system security architecture can be best thought of as a castle with many walls and gates. The outer walls represent the perimeter defenses, such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and anti-virus software.

The next set of walls represents the internal networks, such as the corporate network and data center. These networks contain sensitive information that must be protected from accidental or intentional access by unauthorized users. Finally, there is the innermost sanctum, which is typically where the most sensitive data is located. This data must be protected from both internal and external threats.	systems security architecture	What analogy is used to explain systems security architecture (cybersecurity)?

Just as a castle had walls and towers to protect those inside, organizations have security measures in place (firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, etc.) to protect their data and networks from unauthorized access.	targets	What analogy is used to explain targets (cybersecurity)?
The analogy of a target is used to explain cybersecurity. Just as someone would take aim and fire at a physical target, hackers attempt to breach digital systems in order to exploit them for criminal or malicious purposes. Knowing your company's cyber vulnerabilities and implementing the appropriate security measures can help protect you from becoming a victim of such an attack.	targets	What analogy is used to explain targets (cybersecurity)?
Hitting a bulls-eye on a target is the best way to score points. In cybersecurity, targets are computing systems or networks that are vulnerable to attack. The closer an attacker can get to the bullseye, the more damage they can do.	targets	What analogy is used to explain targets (cybersecurity)?
A technology research and development (cybersecurity) is similar to a thief breaking into a home. The thief may take time examining the doors, windows, and alarm system in order to find the best way to get into the home undetected. Once inside, the thief will look for valuable items to steal. In the same way, cybersecurity researchers examine computer networks and systems in order to find vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers. Once they identify these vulnerabilities, they work on developing solutions to protect against them.	technology research and development	What analogy is used to explain technology research and development (cybersecurity)?
Technology research and development can be best described as a never ending race between hackers and security experts. Hackers are constantly trying to find new ways to breach networks and steal information, while security experts are working hard to create stronger defences against these attacks. Like in any other race, there is always the potential for new challengers to enter the field and upset the balance.	technology research and development	What analogy is used to explain technology research and development (cybersecurity)?

T&E allows individuals and organizations alike to test and evaluate potential cybersecurity threats before they can cause damage.	test and evaluation	What analogy is used to explain test and evaluation (cybersecurity)?
Testing and evaluation is like putting a puzzle together. The various pieces (tests) are used to identify the vulnerabilities in the system (puzzle), and once these are identified, the organization can work on fixing them (evaluation).	test and evaluation	What analogy is used to explain test and evaluation (cybersecurity)?
Testing and evaluation (T&E) is often thought of as akin to a physical fitness regimen. Just as someone who wants to be physically fit must engage in regular exercise, eat a healthy diet, and get enough sleep, so too must someone who wants their cyber defenses to be effective engage in T&E on a regular basis. Like physical fitness, there is no one silver bullet that will make your cyber defenses impenetrable; it takes hard work and dedication.	test and evaluation	What analogy is used to explain test and evaluation (cybersecurity)?
Testing and evaluation is similar to a medical procedure. The doctor or surgeon tests the equipment and patient before surgery to ensure that everything is working properly and that the patient is healthy enough for surgery. In the same way, cybersecurity professionals test systems and networks for vulnerabilities before an attack occurs. They also evaluate how well security controls are working after an attack has taken place.	test and evaluation	What analogy is used to explain test and evaluation (cybersecurity)?
Testing and evaluation can be analogized to an onion. The outer layer is the penetration testing phase, where testers attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the system in order to gain access. Once access is gained, the next layer is vulnerability scanning and assessment, where vulnerabilities are identified and catalogued. The next layer contains patch management and configuration management, which work to correct any vulnerabilities that were found in the previous layers. Finally, at the core of the onion are security operations and incident response, which work to detect and respond to incidents if they occur.	test and evaluation	What analogy is used to explain test and evaluation (cybersecurity)?
Threat (cybersecurity) is often compared to a home invasion. Just as a homeowner takes steps to secure their property against intruders, individuals and organizations need to take steps to protect themselves against cyberthreats.	threat	What analogy is used to explain threat (cybersecurity)?
A firewall can be thought of as a bouncer at a nightclub. The bouncer checks IDs to make sure that everyone who enters the club is old enough to be there. He also looks for signs that people might be planning to cause trouble. The firewall does the same thing with digital information. It compares every request for information against a list of rules and only allows requests that are safe.	threat	What analogy is used to explain threat (cybersecurity)?
A cyberattack is often like a bank robbery. The attacker tries to get in through the door or windows and takes what they can find.	threat	What analogy is used to explain threat (cybersecurity)?

Just as with safes, different systems have different work factors, and some are more difficult to penetrate than others.	work factor	What analogy is used to explain work factor (cybersecurity)?
Just as a lock's security is increased with the addition of more complex keys, a computer system's security can be improved by adding additional layers of protection, such as passwords and firewalls. This makes it more difficult for an attacker to gain access to the system or its data.	work factor	What analogy is used to explain work factor (cybersecurity)?
A possible analogy for worms could be the viruses that infect computers. Worms are self-replicating pieces of software that can spread quickly through an organization's computer systems, just like viruses.	worm	What analogy is used to explain worm (cybersecurity)?
Worm is a cyber security analogy that is used to describe how a virus can spread throughout an entire network. Worms are similar to viruses in that they are self-replicating and can easily be transmitted from one computer system to another. However, worms differ from viruses in that they do not require human interaction in order to propagate. Once released into a network, worms will automatically search for vulnerable systems and infect them. This makes worm attacks particularly dangerous, as they can quickly spread throughout an organization's computer infrastructure without any warning.	worm	What analogy is used to explain worm (cybersecurity)?
Worm is like a computer virus that can spread quickly across the internet.	worm	What analogy is used to explain worm (cybersecurity)?
