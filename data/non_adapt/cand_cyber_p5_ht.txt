Cybersecurity is similar to locking your door. You are only protecting what is inside if you lock the door.	access	Use an analogy to explain access (cybersecurity).
Access is like a key to a door. The more keys you have, the more people can unlock the door. In cybersecurity, access means having the ability to log in to a computer or network and do whatever you want, including stealing information or wreaking havoc. The more people who have access to your computer or network, the greater the risk of someone breaking in and doing damage.	access	Use an analogy to explain access (cybersecurity).
Access is like a key that opens a door. In cybersecurity, access controls are like the lock on the door. They make sure only authorized users can open the door by using their keys (i.e., passwords, PINs, etc.).	access	Use an analogy to explain access (cybersecurity).
It is like having a front door to your house. Anyone can knock on the door and ask to come in, but if you have a lock on the door, they need to have a key to get in. Access control is what decides who has permission (a key) to enter your system.	access	Use an analogy to explain access (cybersecurity).
Think of online security like the door to your house. You might have a deadbolt on the front door, as well as a key that unlocks it from the inside. To get into your house, you need both the key and to turn the knob. If someone has only one of those things, they can't get in (unless they break down the door).	access	Use an analogy to explain access (cybersecurity).
An analogy for access and identity management in cybersecurity is the use of a key to unlock a door. The key is like the user's login credentials, which allow them access to specific areas or systems on the network. Just as you would not give someone else your house key so they could let themselves into your home whenever they pleased, you should not share your login credentials with anyone who does not need access to your data and systems. Likewise, you should always use strong passwords and change them regularly to help protect against unauthorized access.	access and identity management	Use an analogy to explain access and identity management (cybersecurity).
Analogy: Access and identity management is like a person having a key to their house. The key allows the person into their house, and the person can then access all of the contents inside. Similarly, in cybersecurity, access and identity management controls allow users into computer systems and applications, while providing specific permissions for each user. This way, companies can ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data.	access and identity management	Use an analogy to explain access and identity management (cybersecurity).
When you want to go into a building, you need a key to open the door. The identity of the person wanting access is verified against the list of people who are authorized to enter. Once inside, you might need another key to get into specific areas of the building. This process is similar to how access and identity management work in cybersecurity. You need authentication (e.g., a username and password) to verify your identity before gaining access to sensitive data or systems.	access and identity management	Use an analogy to explain access and identity management (cybersecurity).
It is like a house with multiple locks on the doors. The homeowner has a key to each lock. Each person who wants to enter the house must have a key that unlocks at least one of the locks on the door.	access and identity management	Use an analogy to explain access and identity management (cybersecurity).
Access and identity management can be thought of as a bouncer at a club. The bouncer checks IDs to make sure that everyone who is allowed into the club is actually supposed to be there. Access and identity management systems do the same thing for computers, making sure that only authorized users are able to access the information they need.	access and identity management	Use an analogy to explain access and identity management (cybersecurity).
Access control is like a bouncer at a nightclub. He or she decides who gets in and who doesn't by looking at the guest list and ID's. Access control software does the same thing for computers, allowing certain people access to certain files while denying access to others.	access control	Use an analogy to explain access control (cybersecurity).
One way to think about access control is by analogy to the physical world. Imagine that you live in a gated community. In order to enter, you must first show your driver’s license to the security guard at the gate. The guard compares your photo on the license against the person in front of him, and if they match, he allows you to enter. This is analogous to how access control works in cyberspace: You must provide credentials (e.g., a username and password) that are verified by an authority (e.g., a server or application) before you are allowed access.	access control	Use an analogy to explain access control (cybersecurity).
One way to think of access control is as a security guard at the door of a nightclub. The bouncer decides who can enter the club and who cannot. He uses his judgment to decide whether someone is likely to cause trouble in the club or not. In the same way, an access control system determines which users are allowed into a computer system and what they are allowed to do once they are inside.	access control	Use an analogy to explain access control (cybersecurity).
A bank may have a policy that states only employees with a certain security clearance can access the room where the safe is kept. This would be an example of access control because it limits who can enter the room and access the safe.	access control	Use an analogy to explain access control (cybersecurity).
In the physical world, access control is used to restrict or allow people into a certain area. For example, you may need a key to open a door that leads into a restricted area. In the cyber world, access control is used to restrict or allow people access to certain data or systems. For example, you may need a username and password to log into your email account.	access control	Use an analogy to explain access control (cybersecurity).
One analogy for access control is a bouncer at a nightclub. The bouncer checks IDs to make sure that only those who are on the guest list are allowed into the club. Similarly, an access control mechanism in cybersecurity restricts access to systems and data based on permissions assigned to users and devices.	access control mechanism	Use an analogy to explain access control mechanism (cybersecurity).
Access control is like a key lock on a door. The key (access control) determines who can unlock the door and enter the room (the resource).	access control mechanism	Use an analogy to explain access control mechanism (cybersecurity).
One way to think about access control is by analogy to the physical world. Imagine you are at a party and want to talk to someone in another room. You can go into that room, but if the door is closed, you need to get permission from the person inside before you can enter. Access control is like that door: it determines who can have access to what resources and under which conditions.	access control mechanism	Use an analogy to explain access control mechanism (cybersecurity).
One way to think about access control is by analogy to the physical world. Imagine that you are in a library and want to borrow a book from the shelves. To do so, you need to gain access by swiping your library card through the card reader near the door. Once you have done so, the door opens and you can take out the book. In this example, your library card is analogous to your login credentials (e.g., username and password) for logging into a computer system. The card reader is analogous to a security mechanism such as a password prompt or an authentication token device. And finally, borrowing books from the library is analogous to accessing resources on a computer system.	access control mechanism	Use an analogy to explain access control mechanism (cybersecurity).
One analogy for access control mechanisms is the use of a key to unlock a door. The key is a physical object that allows someone to open the door by physically turning the knob. In the world of cybersecurity, a key might be an electronic file that contains authorization information used to allow or deny access to system resources. Like using a key to unlock a door, an access control mechanism uses information (the key) to authorize or deny access to system resources	access control mechanism	Use an analogy to explain access control mechanism (cybersecurity).
Active attack is like someone physically breaking into a building to steal items. They are actively trying to exploit a vulnerability in order to gain access to the desired information or resources.	active attack	Use an analogy to explain active attack (cybersecurity).
An active attack is similar to a physical attack in the real world. For example, someone might try to physically break into your home by kicking down the door or punching through a window. In the cyberworld, an attacker might attempt to break into your computer system by using brute force methods to guess your password, or they may try to install malware on your computer in order to take control of it.	active attack	Use an analogy to explain active attack (cybersecurity).
Active attack is like a physical attacker who uses tools such as guns, knives, or explosives to break into a building and rob the occupants. A cyberactive attacker also uses tools such as malware, viruses, and phishing schemes to gain access to their targets’ systems with the intention of stealing information or causing sabotage.	active attack	Use an analogy to explain active attack (cybersecurity).
Attacking a computer system in an active manner is similar to raiding a camp or town.

An advanced persistent threat (APT) is like a thief who breaks into your house and steals your prized possessions over time. The thief is stealthy and sneaky, and they always seem to be one step ahead of you. They’re also very patient, waiting until you’re not paying attention before making their move.	advanced persistent threat	Use an analogy to explain advanced persistent threat (cybersecurity).
Advanced persistent threats (APT) are like a pack of wolves. They are always looking for an opportunity to attack and they are very persistent in trying to exploit vulnerabilities. They are also very skilled at covering their tracks, so it can be difficult to detect them and stop them from doing damage.	advanced persistent threat	Use an analogy to explain advanced persistent threat (cybersecurity).
The analogy I like to use is that of a thief. A thief may only rob one house in their lifetime, but they can still be considered an expert at robbing houses. In the same way, a hacker may only target one company in their lifetime, but they can still be considered an expert at hacking into companies.	advanced persistent threat	Use an analogy to explain advanced persistent threat (cybersecurity).
Advanced persistent threats can be compared to a virus or malware that continues to spread and infect computers long after it is initially released. Just as with a real-world virus, advanced persistent threats are often designed to exploit security vulnerabilities in order to gain access to systems and data. Once they have infected a system, these threats can be very difficult to remove, and can continue to cause damage over an extended period of time.	advanced persistent threat	Use an analogy to explain advanced persistent threat (cybersecurity).
One analogy for APT is that of a thief who breaks into your house not once, but continues to come back time and again. The thief may not always take something each time, but they are slowly looting your home and you likely won’t even know it’s happening until it’s too late.	advanced persistent threat	Use an analogy to explain advanced persistent threat (cybersecurity).
Hacking and cybersecurity can be thought of as a game of chess. Just like in a game of chess, the two sides (adversaries) are trying to outmaneuver each other while protecting their own pieces. In cybersecurity, an adversary is someone who is trying to penetrate your defenses and steal or destroy your data.	adversary	Use an analogy to explain adversary (cybersecurity).
An adversary in cybersecurity is like a robber who wants to steal your belongings. They are planning on exploiting any possible vulnerability they can find in order to take what they want from you. Just like you would use security measures to protect your home and belongings, you need to do the same online by using strong passwords, software updates, and anti-virus protection.	adversary	Use an analogy to explain adversary (cybersecurity).
Just as in a physical confrontation, an adversary (in cybersecurity) is someone who you are actively competing against or defending against.	adversary	Use an analogy to explain adversary (cybersecurity).

Adversaries in the cybersecurity context are akin to opponents in a physical fight. Just as two people might struggle for control of a knife or fists, adversaries in cyber space seek to gain an advantage over their opponents through various means, including malware, phishing and social engineering attacks.	adversary	Use an analogy to explain adversary (cybersecurity).
Air gap is similar to a physical security measure used to protect information. For example, if you have an office with confidential information inside, you might put up a sign that says "No admittance - Confidential" and keep the door locked. This would be like having an air gap between your office and the rest of the building. To get into your office, someone would need to have a key to unlock the door.If you had a computer in your office with confidential information on it, you might want to make sure that there was no way for someone to access that computer remotely. You could do this by disabling WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities, disabling USB ports, or putting the computer in sleep mode when it's not being used. This would be like having an air gap between your computer and the internet.	air gap	Use an analogy to explain air gap (cybersecurity).
Air gap can be likened to keeping a physical distance between yourself and an assailant in order to protect yourself from harm. In the context of cybersecurity, air gap refers to the use of measures (such as restricted networks and access controls) that prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access to sensitive data or systems.	air gap	Use an analogy to explain air gap (cybersecurity).
An air gap is like a moat around a castle. It is an extra layer of security that helps to protect the castle from attack.	air gap	Use an analogy to explain air gap (cybersecurity).
Air gap can be analogized to a wall between two buildings. One building is the "protected" area, while the other building is the "attack" area. The air gap acts as a physical barrier and prevents any communication or information from passing between the two buildings. In cybersecurity, an air gap can be created by separating computers that are not connected to the internet from those that are connected to the internet. This separation limits access to potential cyber-attacks and helps protect sensitive data.	air gap	Use an analogy to explain air gap (cybersecurity).
An air gap can be thought of as a physical or cyber barrier between two systems or networks that are not connected to one another. Air gaps provide an extra layer of security by preventing unauthorized access and data transfer between systems. For example, you might have an air-gapped network that is used for sensitive military communications, and a separate network that is used for general office communication. The two networks would be physically separated from each other, so there would be no way for someone to hack into the military network through the office network.	air gap	Use an analogy to explain air gap (cybersecurity).
Alert is like a security guard at a bank. They are always on watch for anything out of the ordinary and they will take action to protect the bank and its customers if necessary.

If you are driving down the highway and see a car coming towards you, your brain is alerted to the danger and tells you to take action. In a similar way, if your computer sees an email that looks like it could be from someone trying to hack into your account, your cybersecurity software will alert you so that you can take action to protect yourself.	alert	Use an analogy to explain alert (cybersecurity).
A cybersecurity alert is like a warning from the police that there is a thief in your neighborhood. You need to be on the lookout for suspicious activity and take precautions to protect your belongings.	alert	Use an analogy to explain alert (cybersecurity).
Allowing a user access to a specific resource is like giving them a key to that door. By granting access, you are implicitly trusting the user not to misuse that privilege. The allowlist defines which users or systems are authorized to access certain resources.	allowlist	Use an analogy to explain allowlist (cybersecurity).
Allowing a list of specific IP addresses to access your computer is like giving a key to your house to a select few people. You trust these people and know that they will not cause any harm to your property. By allowing these specific IP addresses access, you are limiting the potential damage that can be caused by unauthorized users.	allowlist	Use an analogy to explain allowlist (cybersecurity).
Allowing a list of pre-approved items, people, or functions to occur while blocking everything else is similar to the way firewalls work in cybersecurity. They allow approved traffic through while blocking all other traffic.	allowlist	Use an analogy to explain allowlist (cybersecurity).
Allowing specific people or items onto your property is analogous to allowing certain IP addresses or applications access to your computer or network in cybersecurity. It allows for a more controlled and secure environment.	allowlist	Use an analogy to explain allowlist (cybersecurity).
Allowing a user access to specific resources on a system is analogous to granting that person permission to enter a building. The person must be authorized and have the correct credentials (e.g., key, badge, password) in order to gain entry. Similarly, the user's actions within the building are restricted by what they are allowed to do while inside (e.g., cannot go into areas not designated for their use). In cybersecurity terms, this would mean that the user can only access certain files or devices on the network and is limited in what actions they may take while logged in.	allowlist	Use an analogy to explain allowlist (cybersecurity).
Source intelligence can be thought of as the ingredients in a recipe. Just like you need specific ingredients to make a dish, you need specific information (sources) to understand and mitigate cybersecurity risks. Sources might include system logs, vulnerability scans, threat data feeds, etc. By understanding the sources of risk, organizations can better protect themselves against cyberattacks.	all source intelligence	Use an analogy to explain all source intelligence (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a puzzle. The more pieces you have, the easier it is to put together the bigger picture. Cybersecurity analysts need all source intelligence (information from various sources) to piece together what’s happening in order to protect their networks and systems.	all source intelligence	Use an analogy to explain all source intelligence (cybersecurity).
Just as a detective in a murder mystery collects all the clues at the crime scene to try and solve the case, cybersecurity analysts collect all clues (called "indicators" of compromise) from computer networks to identify and mitigate cyber threats.	all source intelligence	Use an analogy to explain all source intelligence (cybersecurity).
All source intelligence (cybersecurity) can be thought of as a large and complex jigsaw puzzle. The various pieces of the puzzle include information sourced from open sources (such as newspapers, blogs, and social media), classified sources (such as government reports and private security firms), and proprietary sources (including data breaches and malware). piecing together this disparate information is essential for understanding the full scope of any given cybersecurity incident or threat.	all source intelligence	Use an analogy to explain all source intelligence (cybersecurity).
All source intelligence can be thought of as a big jigsaw puzzle. The various pieces of the puzzle are all different – some are large, some are small; some are straight edged, while others are curved; and so on. To assemble the puzzle, you need to find all of the pieces and then fit them together in the correct order.In the same way, all source intelligence (cybersecurity) involves gathering information from as many different sources as possible and then assembling it into a coherent whole. This can be done by analyzing data from various sensors, monitoring open-source information such as social media posts, and talking to experts in various fields. By understanding all of the different aspects of an attack or security breach, you can develop a more complete picture of what happened and how to best protect your organization against future attacks.	all source intelligence	Use an analogy to explain all source intelligence (cybersecurity).

A good analogy for attack path is a thief trying to rob a house. The thief will start by scouting the property to see what security measures are in place and then try to find the easiest way into the home. Once they have found an entry point, they will work on breaking into the house and stealing as much as possible.	attack path	Use an analogy to explain attack path (cybersecurity).
Attacks against computer systems can be compared to burglaries. The goal of the attacker is to find a way into the system and then exploit any vulnerabilities they find in order to take control of or steal information from the system. Just as a burglar will try different doors and windows until they find one that is unlocked, an attacker will try different exploits until they find one that works. Once the attacker has gained access, they may move around the system undetected just like a thief in someone's home.	attack path	Use an analogy to explain attack path (cybersecurity).
Attack path is like a maze. It is a route that the attacker takes to reach their target. The attacker will try to find the weakest point in the system so they can penetrate it and get to their target.	attack path	Use an analogy to explain attack path (cybersecurity).
An analogy to explain attack path (cybersecurity) is as follows: imagine you are a traveler visiting a new city. You want to see all the sights and experience everything the city has to offer, so you set out on foot without any plan or direction. As you wander around, you come across different attractions and interesting places, but eventually you get lost. The further you go from where you started, the harder it becomes to find your way back, until eventually you’re completely lost and don’t know what to do. This is analogous to an attacker who begins probing a network without having any specific target in mind – they will explore different avenues of attack until they find one that works, at which point they can move on to bigger and more valuable targets within the network. Like the traveler in our analogy, an attacker who is successful in penetrating a network can quickly become entrenched and difficult to remove.	attack path	Use an analogy to explain attack path (cybersecurity).
An attack pattern is like a recipe for how to launch a cyberattack. It describes the steps that an attacker might take to exploit a vulnerability in order to gain access to or damage a system. Attack patterns can help organizations identify potential threats and protect their systems from known attacks.	attack pattern	Use an analogy to explain attack pattern (cybersecurity).
A cyberattack can be thought of as a robber breaking into your house. The attacker may use different methods to try to gain access, such as trying the front door knob or window, or even picking the lock. Once inside, the attacker may steal your possessions or damage your property.	attack pattern	Use an analogy to explain attack pattern (cybersecurity).
One analogy to explain attack patterns in cybersecurity is to think of them as being similar to the way that viruses spread. Just as a virus can spread from one person to another, so too can an attack pattern on a computer system or network. Attackers often use known methods and techniques that have been successful in the past in order to try and exploit vulnerabilities in systems. Understanding how these attacks work and how they can be defended against is essential for maintaining strong security posture.	attack pattern	Use an analogy to explain attack pattern (cybersecurity).
A cyberattack is like an ambush in the jungle. You never know when or where it will happen, but you have to be prepared for it at all times.	attack pattern	Use an analogy to explain attack pattern (cybersecurity).
An analogy to explain attack pattern (cybersecurity) is as follows:Attack patterns are similar to the way that criminals operate. Just as burglars often follow a certain routine when committing a crime, hackers also have preferred methods of attacking systems. By understanding how these attacks work, you can better protect your computer or network from becoming compromised.	attack pattern	Use an analogy to explain attack pattern (cybersecurity).
Attack signature can be thought of as a fingerprint for cyberattacks. Just as every person has unique fingerprints, each cyberattack has its own unique signature. Attack signatures are used by security analysts to identify and track potential threats.	attack signature	Use an analogy to explain attack signature (cybersecurity).
Consider a burglar who is known to break into homes through the front door by prying it open with a crowbar. If you see someone trying to pry your front door open, that person is likely the burglar and you should take appropriate action. The act of prying the door open is the attack signature - it's what identifies this particular burglary attempt as being carried out by the same thief who has targeted other homes in the past. In cybersecurity, an attack signature is a unique pattern of activity that can be used to identify or track specific attacks.	attack signature	Use an analogy to explain attack signature (cybersecurity).
A cyberattack signature is like a fingerprint. Just as each individual has unique fingerprints, every malware attack has its own unique set of characteristics that can be used to identify it. This makes it possible to determine whether an attack was launched from a specific computer or network and take measures to protect against future attacks.	attack signature	Use an analogy to explain attack signature (cybersecurity).
Attack signature can be compared to a fingerprint. Just as every individual has a unique fingerprint, so too does each cyber-attack have its own unique identifying characteristics. Attack signatures can be used by security analysts to identify and track malicious activity, in the same way that law enforcement use fingerprints to identify criminals.	attack signature	Use an analogy to explain attack signature (cybersecurity).
A cyberattack's "signature" can be thought of as its fingerprint. Just as every individual has a unique fingerprint, every cyberattack is unique. This means that each attack leaves behind specific traces or clues that can be used to identify it. Attack signatures can be used to help determine the source of an attack, and they can also be used to protect against future attacks by identifying malicious code or patterns associated with past attacks.	attack signature	Use an analogy to explain attack signature (cybersecurity).
Attack surface can be thought of as the exposed areas of a ship. These are the places where an invader could potentially launch an attack and damage or even sink the vessel. Similarly, in cybersecurity, attack surface is used to describe all of the potential ways an intruder could gain access to a computer system or network and do harm. This includes everything from vulnerable software programs to unsecured ports and protocols. The more points of vulnerability that exist, the larger the attack surface and the greater the risk of a cyberattack.	attack surface	Use an analogy to explain attack surface (cybersecurity).
Attack surface is like the door of a house. The more doors and windows you have, the more opportunity there is for someone to break in. Similarly, the more ways you have to access your computer or network, the more likely it is that someone will find a way to break in.	attack surface	Use an analogy to explain attack surface (cybersecurity).
A company's attack surface is like the gates of a castle. The more entrances that are available, the easier it is for an intruder to gain access. Similarly, the more ways a hacker can get into a network or system, the greater the chance they will find a way in. This is why it's important to reduce the number of potential entry points and make sure all security measures are up-to-date.	attack surface	Use an analogy to explain attack surface (cybersecurity).
Attack surface is like the door of your house. It's the easiest way into your home, and the more doors you have, the easier it is for someone to get in.	attack surface	Use an analogy to explain attack surface (cybersecurity).
The attack surface is like the door of a house. It's the easiest way into the house, and it's where an intruder can find all of the vulnerabilities in your security system. The more doors you have on your house, the harder it is for someone to break in, and the more time they'll need to try different methods until they find one that works. The same principle applies to cybersecurity: The more entry points there are into your system, the easier it is for someone to hack in, and the more damage they can do when they get in.	attack surface	Use an analogy to explain attack surface (cybersecurity).
Attacker (cybersecurity) is like a robber in the night. He sneaks into your house, steals your valuable possessions, and then takes off without a trace.	attacker	Use an analogy to explain attacker (cybersecurity).
An attacker is like a thief who breaks into your house to try and steal your belongings.	attacker	Use an analogy to explain attacker (cybersecurity).
An attacker is like a thief who breaks into your house to steal your belongings.	attacker	Use an analogy to explain attacker (cybersecurity).
Attacker (cybersecurity) is like a home intruder. They are looking for any opportunity they can to exploit your system and steal your data.	attacker	Use an analogy to explain attacker (cybersecurity).
Attacker (cybersecurity) is like an enemy soldier trying to break through your defenses and take over your camp.	attacker	Use an analogy to explain attacker (cybersecurity).
To authenticate is to verify the identify of a user. For example, when you log into your bank account, the bank will ask for your username and password. This is done in order to authenticate that you are who you say you are.	authenticate	Use an analogy to explain authenticate (cybersecurity).
The best way to think of authentication is as a locked door. Before you can enter the room, you have to provide the correct key (or username and password) to unlock it. Authentication is what ensures that only authorized users can access your data or systems.	authenticate	Use an analogy to explain authenticate (cybersecurity).
Authentication is like a bouncer at a club. He checks your ID to make sure you are who you say you are and that you are of age to be in the club. In cybersecurity, authentication is the process of verifying the identify of someone or something.	authenticate	Use an analogy to explain authenticate (cybersecurity).
A user trying to access a secure website is like someone trying to enter a building with a security keypad. The user has to provide the correct password (authentication) in order to be allowed inside.	authenticate	Use an analogy to explain authenticate (cybersecurity).
If you are at a bar and want to order a drink, you need to show your ID to the bartender. The bartender compares the photo on your ID with how you look today and verifies that it is really you. This is similar to what happens when you authenticate yourself online. The website compares the information (like your name and password) that you provide with its records to verify that it is really you.	authenticate	Use an analogy to explain authenticate (cybersecurity).
If you want to be sure that the person letting you into your house is really your friend and not an imposter, you might ask them to prove their identity by providing a password or some other form of authentication. In the same way, when you log in to your email account or bank website, you are usually asked for a username and password – something only you should know – in order to verify that it is really you trying to access the account. This process of verifying someone’s identity is called authentication.	authentication	Use an analogy to explain authentication (cybersecurity).
In cybersecurity, authentication is like a bouncer at a club determining whether somebody is allowed inside. The bouncer checks the person's ID to make sure that they are on the guest list and are of age to enter the club. If everything matches up, then the bouncer will allow them inside. Authentication in cybersecurity works in a similar way. It determines whether or not someone is who they say they are and if they are authorized to access certain information or systems.	authentication	Use an analogy to explain authentication (cybersecurity).
An analogy for authentication is a key. The key unlocks the door to your house so you can enter. In the same way, authentication is a process that uses something you know (the key), along with something you have (the physical key), to verify your identity. This prevents someone from pretending to be you and accessing your account or data.	authentication	Use an analogy to explain authentication (cybersecurity).
It is similar to a bouncer at a club deciding whether or not to let someone into the club. The bouncer checks the person's ID to make sure that they are who they say they are and that they are allowed into the club. In the same way, authentication checks to make sure that you are who you say you are and allows you access to the requested resource.	authentication	Use an analogy to explain authentication (cybersecurity).
In the cybersecurity world, authentication is like a bouncer at a club. He checks your ID to make sure you are who you say you are and that you are of legal drinking age. In the same way, authentication checks your identity against a list of approved identities (usually in the form of usernames and passwords) to verify that you are allowed access to the system or data.	authentication	Use an analogy to explain authentication (cybersecurity).
Authenticity in cybersecurity can be best explained using the analogy of a bank vault. The bank vault is a secure place where the bank's money is stored. To ensure that only authorized individuals have access to the money, the bank uses a variety of security measures, including keypad locks, fingerprint scanners, and video surveillance. These security measures help to ensure that only authorized individuals can gain access to the money inside the vault. In much the same way, cybersecurity measures are used to protect online assets from unauthorized access. By using firewalls, passwords, and other security technologies, businesses can protect their data from cyber threats.	authenticity	Use an analogy to explain authenticity (cybersecurity).
If you are at a dinner party and someone tells a story that they heard from someone else, you would not consider that story to be authentic. However, if the person who told the story is the one who experienced it firsthand, then you would consider that story to be authentic. In the same way, when it comes to cybersecurity, you need to make sure that you are only trusting information that has come directly from the source. This means verifying the authenticity of data before taking any action based on that information.	authenticity	Use an analogy to explain authenticity (cybersecurity).
If you are buying a diamond ring, you would want to make sure it is authentic. This means that the diamond is real and not fake. In the same way, when you are using the internet, you want to make sure your information is safe and not being hacked.	authenticity	Use an analogy to explain authenticity (cybersecurity).
Authenticity in cybersecurity can be compared to a person’s identity. Just as you would want to know for certain that the person standing in front of you is who they say they are, you want to be sure that the information you are receiving online is authentic and has not been tampered with. This is done by verifying the source of the data and using security measures such as passwords and encryption to keep it safe.	authenticity	Use an analogy to explain authenticity (cybersecurity).
Authenticity can be compared to a locked door. The lock is the authentication method and the key is the authentication token. In order for someone to enter, they must have the correct key. Without it, they cannot get in.	authenticity	Use an analogy to explain authenticity (cybersecurity).
Authorization is like a guard at the door of a building. The guard checks to see if you have permission to enter before letting you in. Authorization is used in cybersecurity to make sure that only authorized users can access sensitive data or systems.	authorization	Use an analogy to explain authorization (cybersecurity).
One analogy for authorization is granting someone access to your home. You may give a friend or family member a key to your house so that they can come and go as they please. Another person, such as a delivery person, may need to be given permission by you in order to enter your home. This analogy can be used when thinking about the different levels of access that are granted to different users on a computer system. For example, you may have administrator privileges which allow you to make changes to the system settings, while other users may only have limited privileges which allow them to view and edit certain files.	authorization	Use an analogy to explain authorization (cybersecurity).
Authorization is like a bouncer at a club. They are looking to see if you are on the list, and if you are not they will not let you in. Authorization is checking to see if someone has permission to do something.	authorization	Use an analogy to explain authorization (cybersecurity).
When you go to a store, you need to show your driver's license in order to buy alcohol. The cashier is authorized to sell alcohol because she has been given permission by the state government to do so. This is similar to how cybersecurity authorization works - certain users are given permission by an organization (e.g., the state government) to access specific resources (e.g., alcohol).	authorization	Use an analogy to explain authorization (cybersecurity).
If you wanted to borrow a car from your friend, you would need to ask for their permission (authorization). This is because they are the ones who own the car. In the same way, when you try to access a file or folder on a computer, you need authorization from the owner of that file or folder in order to be able to view it or edit it.	authorization	Use an analogy to explain authorization (cybersecurity).
If availability is the door to your house, then cybersecurity would be the locks on that door. You might leave the key under the mat for easy access, but you’re also likely to have a deadbolt or security system as another line of defense. Cybersecurity measures are like those extra locks—they make it more difficult for someone to get into your house, even if they have the key.	availability	Use an analogy to explain availability (cybersecurity).
Availability can be best analogized to a water tower. Just as municipalities use large tanks or towers to store and distribute water throughout the city, organizations use cybersecurity measures to protect and make available their electronic resources. In both cases, if the tank is compromised or there is too little pressure in the municipal water system, residents will face disruptions in their service. The same is true for cyber-attacks; if an organization’s defenses are breached, its systems and data will be unavailable until the attack is mitigated.	availability	Use an analogy to explain availability (cybersecurity).
Availability is like a bank. The bank has money that people can use, but only if they have the right access. Money is available to anyone who has a checking or savings account, and the bank makes it available by providing them with a debit card or checks. In the same way, cybersecurity provides the tools necessary for people to access information systems and protect their data.	availability	Use an analogy to explain availability (cybersecurity).
Availability can be analogized to a fire hose. Imagine that you are fighting a large fire and need as much water as possible to extinguish the flames. A firefighter would not be very effective if he had to stop every few minutes to refill his tank; likewise, a computer is not very useful if it cannot connect to the internet or is unavailable for use. Just as firefighters must ensure that their hoses are always available, computer users must make sure that their devices and networks are accessible at all times.	availability	Use an analogy to explain availability (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is similar to a locked door. The door can be locked with a key or a combination lock. The key is available to anyone who wants it, while the combination is only available to people who know it.	availability	Use an analogy to explain availability (cybersecurity).
Behavior monitoring is like a security guard watching people who enter and exit a building. The security guard watches to make sure that everyone is following the rules and not doing anything illegal. Behavior monitoring in cybersecurity works in the same way. It monitors all the activity on your computer or network to make sure that everyone is following the rules and not doing anything illegal.	behavior monitoring	Use an analogy to explain behavior monitoring (cybersecurity).
Behavior monitoring is like keeping an eye on your house when you are away. You know what is normal for your house when you are home and can tell if something is different when you are not there. Behavior monitoring in cybersecurity uses the same idea to watch for anything that seems out of the ordinary, like someone trying to hack into your account or steal your data.	behavior monitoring	Use an analogy to explain behavior monitoring (cybersecurity).
Behavior monitoring can be thought of as a security camera in a store. The camera records the behavior of everyone who enters and leaves the store, allowing the store to keep track of who is coming and going. In the same way, behavior monitoring software records the keystrokes and mouse movements of all users on a computer system, allowing administrators to keep track of what users are doing on the system.	behavior monitoring	Use an analogy to explain behavior monitoring (cybersecurity).
Behavior monitoring (cybersecurity) is like a security guard watching people who enter and leave a building. The security guard looks for any unusual activity, such as someone trying to open a door that isn't supposed to be opened or someone walking out with something they shouldn't have. Behavior monitoring (cybersecurity) also watches for any strange behavior online, such as someone sending too many emails or visiting websites they normally wouldn't visit.	behavior monitoring	Use an analogy to explain behavior monitoring (cybersecurity).
Behavior monitoring is like keeping an eye on a person's behavior to ensure that they are not doing anything bad or illegal. In the same way, behavior monitoring in cybersecurity is used to keep track of people's computer activity to make sure that they are not doing anything malicious or harmful.	behavior monitoring	Use an analogy to explain behavior monitoring (cybersecurity).
A blocklist can be thought of as a list of items or websites that are not allowed on a computer. This could be done for many reasons, such as to protect the computer from viruses or malware, or to prevent access to certain content.	blocklist	Use an analogy to explain blocklist (cybersecurity).
An example analogy to help explain a blocklist (in cybersecurity) would be to imagine that you are at a busy shopping mall and want to avoid getting caught up in any potential fights or altercations. One way of doing this would be to keep your head down, avoid eye contact with anyone who looks like they may be argumentative, and quickly weave through the crowd as you make your way to your desired destination. In a similar fashion, keeping track of a list of IP addresses or domains that have been flagged for malicious activities can allow you to more easily navigate around potential cyber threats and protect your computer networks from being compromised.	blocklist	Use an analogy to explain blocklist (cybersecurity).
A blocklist can be thought of as a blacklist, but for IP addresses instead of email addresses. A blocklist is a list of IP addresses that have been flagged as being associated with malicious activity. When an IP address is flagged, the owner of the blocklist will prevent any traffic from flowing to or from that address.	blocklist	Use an analogy to explain blocklist (cybersecurity).
A blocklist can be thought of as a list of bad actors or unsafe websites. When enabled, a blocker will prevent these sites from being accessed on your device. This helps to keep you safe online by preventing you from visiting potentially harmful websites or interacting with known malicious entities.	blocklist	Use an analogy to explain blocklist (cybersecurity).
A blocklist can be thought of as a list of IP addresses or domains that are not allowed to connect to your network. This can help protect you from malicious traffic and keep your systems safe.	blocklist	Use an analogy to explain blocklist (cybersecurity).

In the context of cybersecurity, blue teams are responsible for identifying and preventing cyber-attacks against organizations.	blue team	Use an analogy to explain blue team (cybersecurity).
A blue team in cybersecurity is analogous to a defensive football team. The blue team's goal is to prevent the red team from penetrating their defenses and gaining access to their systems and data. just as a football defense tries to stop the offense from advancing downfield, the blue team uses security controls such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and anti-virus software to protect their systems.	blue team	Use an analogy to explain blue team (cybersecurity).
A blue team is a cybersecurity term for a group of people employed by an organization who work to identify and protect that organization's systems against cyberattacks. The blue team's goal is to prevent successful breaches and defend the company's networks, systems, and data from unauthorized access or theft.	blue team	Use an analogy to explain blue team (cybersecurity).
Red team is like an attacker who is trying to penetrate into a network or system, while blue team is the defender who tries to prevent the attacker from succeeding.	blue team	Use an analogy to explain blue team (cybersecurity).
If you think of bots as being like tiny, autonomous robots that can be instructed to do specific tasks, then you can start to see how they can be used for cybersecurity purposes.

Cybersecurity solutions use software and hardware tools to identify malicious traffic, block access to infected websites and servers, and prevent data theft.	bot	Use an analogy to explain bot (cybersecurity).
A bot is a bit like a baby. It's new, it needs to be nurtured and it has the potential to do great things. Bots are automated programs that run on devices such as computers or phones. They can help you with tasks such as booking appointments or ordering food. But bots can also be used for malicious activities, such as stealing your personal information or spamming your friends with unwanted messages. Just like babies, bots need to be protected from harm and taught the right way to behave.	bot	Use an analogy to explain bot (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a bot defending your computer against viruses and other online threats.	bot	Use an analogy to explain bot (cybersecurity).
A bot herder is like a shepherd for sheep. The bot herder's job is to keep an eye on the bots and make sure they are doing their job, just like a shepherd makes sure his sheep are following the path and not getting lost.	bot herder	Use an analogy to explain bot herder (cybersecurity).

Bot masters use their knowledge of how bots work and how to exploit vulnerabilities to take control of large numbers of them and use them for criminal purposes.	bot master	Use an analogy to explain bot master (cybersecurity).
A botnet is like a pack of wolves. The wolves are the bots and the cybercrime they commit is the hunting. Cybercriminals use botnets to automate their attacks and overwhelm targets with simultaneous requests, making it difficult for them to defend against or track down the criminals behind them.	botnet	Use an analogy to explain botnet (cybersecurity).
A botnet can be thought of as a herd of zombies. The zombie apocalypse has begun, and the brains of all the living humans have been infected with a virus that turns them into mindless slaves. They walk around in a daze until they see someone else who is also infected, and then they attack together. Zombies are slow and weak individually, but when they work together they can be powerful and dangerous.	botnet	Use an analogy to explain botnet (cybersecurity).
A botnet can be thought of as a herd of feral animals. Just like a pack of wolves or a pride of lions, these animals are much more dangerous when they work together than when they are alone.

You also need someone who can monitor the castle for any signs of trouble and who can take action quickly if there is a problem.	build security in	Use an analogy to explain build security in (cybersecurity).
Think of a fortress. A fortress has thick walls that are designed to keep people out. It also has strong gates that are difficult to open. The people inside the fortress can see what is happening outside, and they can shoot arrows or throw rocks at anyone who tries to get in.	build security in	Use an analogy to explain build security in (cybersecurity).
The security of a building can be thought of as similar to the security of data in cyberspace. Just as buildings have locks on their doors and windows, cyber systems can use firewalls, passwords and other measures to keep unauthorized users out. Like physical security, cyber security must be constantly updated as new threats emerge.	build security in	Use an analogy to explain build security in (cybersecurity).
Build security in (cybersecurity) is like building a fortress to protect your home. You put up walls, install alarms and locks, and use other deterrents to keep people from getting inside. You also make sure that the people who live in your home are safe and secure. In the same way, you need to build security into your computer systems so that unauthorized people can't get access to your data or corrupt your systems. You also need to make sure that the data you store is safe and secure.	build security in	Use an analogy to explain build security in (cybersecurity).
The Department of Homeland Security's cyber-security capabilities are like a city's fire department. DHS has personnel, equipment and plans in place to respond to cyber incidents - both big and small. Just as the city's firefighters are trained to put out fires, DHS' cyber experts are trained to mitigate and respond to cyber incidents.	capability	Use an analogy to explain capability (cybersecurity).
Capability in cybersecurity can be compared to a lock on a door. The lock is what keeps the door closed and prevents unauthorized individuals from entering.

Cloud computing is like having a lock box that you can store your personal belongings in. You can access your lock box from anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection. However, if someone tries to break into your lock box, they will be unsuccessful because it is protected by a password.	cloud computing	Use an analogy to explain cloud computing (cybersecurity).
Cloud computing is like using an umbrella to stay dry in the rain. Umbrellas protect people from getting wet, just as cloud computing protects people from cyberattacks.	cloud computing	Use an analogy to explain cloud computing (cybersecurity).
One analogy for cloud computing is the way in which people use a public library. Just as people go to the library to borrow books, they can also access information and applications on servers located there without having to install them on their individual devices. Similarly, with cloud computing, users can access data and software from remote servers rather than storing everything on their own machines. This allows individuals and businesses to save space on their computers and improve efficiency since they no longer need to manage hardware and software themselves. From a cybersecurity standpoint, one advantage of using the cloud is that companies can more easily deploy security updates and patches when necessary. Additionally, by using multiple layers of security measures (such as firewalls), businesses can better protect their networks and data from unauthorized access or theft.	cloud computing	Use an analogy to explain cloud computing (cybersecurity).
Cloud computing can be thought of as a large, secure room that businesses can use to store their data. This room is accessible via the internet, so employees can access it from anywhere in the world. The business can choose to keep some or all of this data in the cloud, depending on its needs.	cloud computing	Use an analogy to explain cloud computing (cybersecurity).
Collecting and operating on cybersecurity data is like a baseball coach watching game film to scout the opposing team. The coach collects data by observing the other team’s players during the game and records what they do well and what they struggle with. Then, the coach uses this information to operate by creating a strategy that takes advantage of the opposition’s weaknesses while minimizing their strengths. In cybersecurity, collectors gather data about potential threats (e.g., malware) and then operators use this data to protect networks from being compromised.	collect &amp; operate	Use an analogy to explain collect &amp; operate (cybersecurity).
Collect &amp; operate is like a city's water system. The city collects water from various sources and operates the treatment plants to make sure the water is clean before sending it out to customers.	collect &amp; operate	Use an analogy to explain collect &amp; operate (cybersecurity).
An analogy for collect & operate (cybersecurity) would be to think of a computer as a car. The gasoline that powers the car is collected from the pump, and then operated through the use of various controls in the car. In a similar way, data is collected from various sources online, and then operated through the use of security measures to protect it.	collect &amp; operate	Use an analogy to explain collect &amp; operate (cybersecurity).
Operating a computer system and collecting data are like driving a car. The driver (operator) must be aware of the condition of the car (operate), and keep track of where they are going (collect).	collect &amp; operate	Use an analogy to explain collect &amp; operate (cybersecurity).
If you think of your computer as a car, the security software installed on it is like the brakes.

Collection operations in cybersecurity can be thought of as akin to the way a vacuum cleaner collects dirt from a floor. In both cases, something is being drawn towards or pulled towards the collection point. In the case of cybersecurity, malicious code and other cyber threats are being drawn towards or pulled towards points where they can be detected and then neutralized.	collection operations	Use an analogy to explain collection operations (cybersecurity).
Collection operations are like a net that is being thrown out in the ocean to catch fish. The more holes there are in the net, the more fish will get through. Similarly, the more vulnerabilities there are in your networks and systems, the easier it is for an attacker to steal your data or take control of your systems.	collection operations	Use an analogy to explain collection operations (cybersecurity).
Collection operations (cybersecurity) are like a net that is being thrown out in the ocean to capture fish. The net has a large surface area so it can catch as many fish as possible. Similarly, collection operations (cybersecurity) use various techniques to collect data from different sources in order to identify and protect against cyber threats.	collection operations	Use an analogy to explain collection operations (cybersecurity).

Security personnel monitor the security systems and respond to any alarms that are triggered.	computer network defense	Use an analogy to explain computer network defense (cybersecurity).
A computer network defense (cybersecurity) can be analogy as a castle with walls and gates. The walls are the perimeter of the network and the gates are the points of entry. The defenders are the people who protect the castle from attack and the attackers are trying to breach the defenses and get into the castle.	computer network defense	Use an analogy to explain computer network defense (cybersecurity).
Network defense (cybersecurity) can be analogized to the defensive measures taken by a castle's inhabitants to protect the stronghold from attack. Just as the walls and moat of a castle served as barriers against potential invaders, cybersecurity defenses are intended to keep unauthorized users out of computer networks and systems. Likewise, defenders in a medieval fortress would have used archers, crossbows and boiling oil to repel attackers, while network defenders use firewalls, antivirus software and intrusion detection/prevention systems to thwart cyberattacks.	computer network defense	Use an analogy to explain computer network defense (cybersecurity).
Just as a fortress is designed to protect its inhabitants from enemies, a computer network's defense system (cybersecurity) is meant to safeguard the network and its users from digital threats. Network defenses use various methods to identify and block malicious traffic, while also protecting user identities and data.	computer network defense	Use an analogy to explain computer network defense (cybersecurity).
Let's say you're a homeowner and you want to make sure that your house is safe from burglars. You might install a security system with alarms, cameras, and motion detectors. If someone breaks into your house, the alarm will sound, the camera will record them, and the motion detector will tell you where they are in your house. In the same way, computer network defense analysis (cybersecurity) is like installing a security system for your computer networks. It involves using tools like firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems to protect your computers from hackers and other online threats.	computer network defense analysis	Use an analogy to explain computer network defense analysis (cybersecurity).
Just as a physician would use various medical devices to diagnose an illness, a computer network defense analyst (cybersecurity specialist) uses various tools to analyze and diagnose cyberattacks and security incidents. One analogy is using an X-ray machine to look inside someone's body and see what might be wrong. Similarly, cybersecurity specialists use intrusion detection systems (IDS), packet analyzers, forensic analysis tools, and other technologies to "look inside" computer networks in order to find signs of malicious activity or other security incidents.	computer network defense analysis	Use an analogy to explain computer network defense analysis (cybersecurity).
A computer network is like a city. The computers are the buildings and the people are the data packets that move back and forth between them.

Additionally, they must constantly monitor networks for signs of intrusion or attack.	computer network defense analysis	Use an analogy to explain computer network defense analysis (cybersecurity).
One common analogy for cybersecurity is that it is like a "lock on the door." Just as you would protect your home by locking your doors, you protect your computer networks by using security measures such as firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption. By securing your network, you make it much more difficult for hackers to gain access and steal information or disrupt business operations.	computer network defense analysis	Use an analogy to explain computer network defense analysis (cybersecurity).
Just as there are many different types of roads and highways that support vehicular traffic across a region or country, there is a vast array of computer networks that comprise the Internet. Just as it is necessary to maintain and upgrade the infrastructure of roadways—including bridges, overpasses, tunnels, and interchanges—to ensure safe passage for drivers, so too must cybersecurity experts continually shore up the defenses of computer networks to protect them from attack. This involves installing firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and other security tools; monitoring network activity for signs of malicious or unauthorized behavior; and creating policies and procedures to help prevent attacks and mitigate their effects.	computer network defense infrastructure support	Use an analogy to explain computer network defense infrastructure support (cybersecurity).
A cyberdefense infrastructure is like a castle with high walls and a moat. The walls protect the inhabitants from intruders, while the moat deters attackers from coming near.

Just as you would want a strong police and fire department protecting your city, you want a strong cyber security team protecting your computer network.	computer network defense infrastructure support	Use an analogy to explain computer network defense infrastructure support (cybersecurity).
Just as a city has different types of infrastructure to keep the city running (e.g., water, power, and sewer systems), a computer network also has different types of infrastructure that are needed to keep the network running securely. The most important part of the cyber defense infrastructure is the firewall. The firewall is like a wall between the internal networks within an organization and the external Internet. It restricts access to authorized users and blocks unauthorized access attempts. In addition to firewalls, there are other components that make up a strong cybersecurity program, including: - Antivirus software: Used to protect devices from viruses and malware- intrusion detection/prevention systems: Monitors for unusual or suspicious activity on the network and can help prevent attacks before they happen- Security information and event management (SIEM) system: Collects data from various security devices across the network so organizations can track events and identify potential threats	computer network defense infrastructure support	Use an analogy to explain computer network defense infrastructure support (cybersecurity).

Computer security incidents (cybersecurity) can be thought of as being similar to a home invasion. Just as someone breaking into your house can cause a lot of damage, so too can someone gaining access to your computer or network without proper authorization. In both cases, the person who breaks in is looking for something they can take advantage of—money, personal information, or simply access to the property itself. And in both cases, it’s up to you to do what you can to make your home or computer as secure as possible against such intrusions.	computer security incident	Use an analogy to explain computer security incident (cybersecurity).
A computer security incident is like a burglary. Just as a burglar can break into your home and steal your possessions, a hacker can break into your computer and steal your information.	computer security incident	Use an analogy to explain computer security incident (cybersecurity).
A cybersecurity incident can be likened to a home burglary. In both cases, someone has unauthorized access to something that they should not have access to.

Cybersecurity is like locking your door at night. You may feel safe and secure inside your house, but if you don't lock the door, anyone can come in. Cybersecurity is about protecting your information by using passwords, firewalls and other tools to keep people out who shouldn't have access.	confidentiality	Use an analogy to explain confidentiality (cybersecurity).
When you are in a confidential meeting, you may tell the other participants things that you wouldn't want others to know. In the same way, when you are using a computer, you may share information with other people on your network that you don't want others to see or access. Confidentiality (cybersecurity) is about making sure that only authorized people can see and/or access sensitive information.	confidentiality	Use an analogy to explain confidentiality (cybersecurity).
Confidentiality can be best understood using the analogy of a locked filing cabinet. The information contained within is accessible only to those with the key to unlock it. In the same way, confidential data stored on a computer is accessible only to those who have been granted access permission by the system administrator.	confidentiality	Use an analogy to explain confidentiality (cybersecurity).

If you do not change your car's oil every 5,000 miles, the engine will seize and you will be unable to drive your car. The consequence of this is that you will have to take your car to a mechanic to get it fixed and it will likely cost you money.	consequence	Use an analogy to explain consequence (cybersecurity).
Consequence can be best thought of as the potential outcome of an event. In cybersecurity, consequences could range from a minor inconvenience to a complete system crash. It's important to understand the possible consequences of any action - or inaction - in order to make informed decisions about how best to protect your data and systems.	consequence	Use an analogy to explain consequence (cybersecurity).

The cyber infrastructure is a vital part of our national security and economic well-being and must be protected from malicious attacks.	critical infrastructure	Use an analogy to explain critical infrastructure (cybersecurity).
Critical infrastructure and key resources (CIKR) are the lifeblood of our society. Just as our physical infrastructure is vital to our way of life, so too is our digital infrastructure. The systems and networks that make up our critical cyberinfrastructure are increasingly interconnected and relied upon for essential services such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and energy. To ensure these systems remain available and resilient in the event of a disruption or attack, it is important to identify and protect CIKR from potential threats.	critical infrastructure and key resources	Use an analogy to explain critical infrastructure and key resources (cybersecurity).
A key resource in cybersecurity is a firewall. A firewall is like a big rock sitting in the middle of a river. The water can flow around the rock, but the bigger the rock, the harder it is for the water to get through. Cybersecurity is like that big rock. It's not impossible for someone to break into your computer or network, but it's a lot harder than if you don't have any cybersecurity measures in place. Critical infrastructure would be like the bridge that crosses over the river. If someone wants to get from one side of the river to another, they need to go through the bridge. In order for someone to attack critical infrastructure, they would have to go through all of your cybersecurity measures first - just like how someone would have to go through the bridge to cross over the river	critical infrastructure and key resources	Use an analogy to explain critical infrastructure and key resources (cybersecurity).

Cryptology is used to protect information from unauthorized access by encrypting it with a specific key.	cryptology	Use an analogy to explain cryptology (cybersecurity).
Cryptology is like a lock on your door. It protects whatever is inside from being accessed by people who do not have the key. Cryptography is the process of creating and using keys to encrypt and decrypt data.	cryptology	Use an analogy to explain cryptology (cybersecurity).
Customer service is like a front desk at a hotel. They are the first people that guests see when they walk in and they help with whatever needs the guests have. Technical support is like the engineers who work behind the scenes to make sure everything in the hotel runs smoothly. They are responsible for fixing any problems that occur and making sure all of the equipment is working properly. Cybersecurity is like keeping everyone safe while they are in the hotel. They make sure that no one can hack into the system and steal information or damage the computers.	customer service and technical support	Use an analogy to explain customer service and technical support (cybersecurity).
Customer service is like a person at a help desk. They are your first line of defense and they can help you with basic issues that you may have with your product. Technical support is like the person who comes to fix your computer when it is broken. They are more knowledgeable about the product and can help you with more complicated issues. Cybersecurity is like the locks on your door. It is there to protect your information from being accessed by unauthorized people.	customer service and technical support	Use an analogy to explain customer service and technical support (cybersecurity).
Customer service is like a person’s first impression of a company. Technical support is like the person’s follow-up and what they do to help resolve an issue. Cybersecurity is like the locks on the doors and how well they are protected from thieves.	customer service and technical support	Use an analogy to explain customer service and technical support (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like customer service in that it is the practice of providing support to customers or users. Customer service often involves troubleshooting, while cybersecurity does the same for computer systems and networks. Just as good customer service can make all the difference for a business, good cybersecurity can protect against data breaches, viruses, and other cyber threats.	customer service and technical support	Use an analogy to explain customer service and technical support (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like customer service in that it is a support system for people. Cybersecurity provides the necessary tools and protection to keep people safe online, just as customer service does for customers in person. Both systems work to resolve issues and protect people from harm.	customer service and technical support	Use an analogy to explain customer service and technical support (cybersecurity).
Just as an ecosystem is a collection of living things and their environment, cybersecurity is the protection of electronic resources and information systems from unauthorized access or destruction. The cyber ecosystem contains many interconnected parts, each with its own role in protecting the whole. Just as different plants and animals inhabit different parts of an ecosystem, there are various types of cybersecurity professionals who work together to secure cyberspace.	cyber ecosystem	Use an analogy to explain cyber ecosystem (cybersecurity).
Just as in a natural ecosystem, there is a delicate balance of different organisms and their environment in the cyber ecosystem. Too much or too little of one element can upset the balance, potentially leading to disaster. The various elements in the cyber ecosystem include organizations such as businesses, governments, and NGOs; users such as employees and citizens; technology infrastructure including networks and systems; plus threats and vulnerabilities. Each has a role to play, but if any one part becomes too dominant or out of balance, it can create serious risks for everyone involved.	cyber ecosystem	Use an analogy to explain cyber ecosystem (cybersecurity).
If you think of the Internet as a jungle, then think of cybersecurity as protecting that jungle from harm. Just like in the real world, there are dangers lurking in the digital ecosystem — hackers looking to steal personal information, malware designed to take down networks, and cybercriminals seeking financial gain. Cybersecurity is what protects us from these threats, by securing our computer systems and data with firewalls, anti-virus software, and other security measures.	cyber ecosystem	Use an analogy to explain cyber ecosystem (cybersecurity).
The cyber ecosystem can be thought of as a rainforest. Just like in a rainforest, there is a vast and interconnected web of life with many different species all working together to create an intricate system. The cyber ecosystem is made up of billions of devices connected to the internet, each with its own unique IP address. These devices include computers, routers, smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, cars and even industrial control systems. Each device has the potential to be hacked and used for malicious purposes.Just like in a rainforest, the cyber ecosystem is constantly changing and evolving. New threats are emerging all the time and businesses need to stay vigilant in order to protect themselves against them. It's important for businesses to have comprehensive cybersecurity solutions in place that can identify and mitigate these threats before they cause harm.	cyber ecosystem	Use an analogy to explain cyber ecosystem (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a ecosystem because it has different parts that all work together to protect the system. The different parts of the cyber ecosystem include users, devices, networks, data, and applications. Each part has its own role in protecting the system and needs to work together to be effective. For example, users need to be aware of phishing attacks and how to protect their passwords, devices need security updates and anti-virus software installed, networks need firewalls configured correctly, data needs to be encrypted when stored or transmitted, and applications need patches applied regularly. If any one of these components fails to do its job properly, it can leave the system vulnerable to attack.	cyber ecosystem	Use an analogy to explain cyber ecosystem (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like locking your house. You might use a deadbolt, or a chain and padlock. The idea is to make it as hard as possible for someone to break into your house. Cybersecurity is the same way. You are trying to make it difficult for someone to hack into your computer system.	cyber exercise	Use an analogy to explain cyber exercise (cybersecurity).
Cyber exercise can be likened to a fire drill. Just as individuals and businesses must practice what to do in the event of a fire, they must also rehearse how to respond to cyber incidents. By regularly participating in cyber exercises, organizations can improve their response time and coordination when an actual attack occurs.	cyber exercise	Use an analogy to explain cyber exercise (cybersecurity).
A cyber exercise is like a fire drill. It's a way to practice and prepare for an emergency by simulating the event.

This helps ensure that everyone knows what to do if an attack occurs and that the necessary steps are taken to minimize any damage.	cyber exercise	Use an analogy to explain cyber exercise (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a locked door. You may have the best lock in the world, but if someone has a key to your house, they can unlock the door and come inside. The same is true for cybersecurity - you may have the best security measures in place, but if someone knows how to get around them, they can access your data or systems.	cyber incident	Use an analogy to explain cyber incident (cybersecurity).
A cyber incident is like a car accident. Just as cars can have different levels of safety features, from basic to advanced, so too are there different levels of cybersecurity protection. However, no matter how safe your car may be, it is always possible for an accident to occur. In the same way, even with robust cybersecurity measures in place, organizations can still experience cyber incidents caused by various factors such as human error or malicious actors.	cyber incident	Use an analogy to explain cyber incident (cybersecurity).
A cyber incident is like a car accident. Just as there are many different ways to have a car accident, there are many different ways to have a cyber incident. In both cases, you may not be sure what happened or how it happened until after the fact.	cyber incident	Use an analogy to explain cyber incident (cybersecurity).

Just as a fire can cause extensive damage if not properly extinguished, cybersecurity incidents (e.g., data breaches, hacks) can have serious consequences for organizations if not properly managed.	cyber incident	Use an analogy to explain cyber incident (cybersecurity).
A cyber incident is similar to a natural disaster in that both can cause significant damage and disruption. A hurricane, for example, can wreak havoc on a coastal community, damaging homes and businesses and knocking out power and transportation systems. In the same way, a cyberattack can disable networks, overload servers with traffic or encrypt important data so that it's inaccessible.	cyber incident	Use an analogy to explain cyber incident (cybersecurity).
A cybersecurity incident response plan is similar to a fire drill. Just as you would have a plan in place for what to do if there was a fire in your building, you need a plan in place for how to respond to a cyber incident. The goal of the cybersecurity incident response plan is to help minimize the damage and protect your organization's data.	cyber incident response plan	Use an analogy to explain cyber incident response plan (cybersecurity).
A cyber incident response plan (cybersecurity) can be thought of as a fire drill. Just like you have a plan in place for what to do if there is a fire in your building, you need a plan in place for what to do if your organization experiences a cyber incident. This includes having procedures in place for detecting, responding to, and recovering from cyber incidents.	cyber incident response plan	Use an analogy to explain cyber incident response plan (cybersecurity).
A cyber incident response plan is like a fire drill.

The purpose of both drills is to make sure everyone knows what to do in case of an emergency.	cyber incident response plan	Use an analogy to explain cyber incident response plan (cybersecurity).
A cyber incident response plan is similar to a fire drill. You have a plan in place for what to do if there is a fire, and you practice it so everyone knows what to do. The same is true for cybersecurity. You have a plan in place for what to do if there is a cyber attack, and you practice it so everyone knows what to do.	cyber incident response plan	Use an analogy to explain cyber incident response plan (cybersecurity).
A cybersecurity incident response plan can be thought of as a fire drill playbook. Just as firefighters have a set of instructions to follow in the event of a fire, organizations with a cyber incident response plan have specific steps they will take in order to protect their systems and data from being compromised.	cyber incident response plan	Use an analogy to explain cyber incident response plan (cybersecurity).
The cyber infrastructure can be thought of as a series of interconnected tubes. Attackers only need to find one leak in order to exploit the system. Organizations must protect all points of entry into order to maintain security.	cyber infrastructure	Use an analogy to explain cyber infrastructure (cybersecurity).
A cyber infrastructure can be thought of as the equivalent of a physical infrastructure, such as roads, bridges and tunnels. Just as these physical structures are essential for connecting people and goods, so too is the cyber infrastructure necessary for enabling commerce and communication in the digital age. Like a physical infrastructure, the cyber infrastructure must be protected from attack or damage if it is to remain functioning and useful.	cyber infrastructure	Use an analogy to explain cyber infrastructure (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a locksmith. Locksmiths protect your home by installing and maintaining locks on exterior doors and windows. They also provide security consultation, so you can make informed decisions about how best to protect your home. Cybersecurity professionals do the same for your computer networks and digital devices – they install and maintain security features, advise you on risk reduction strategies, and help keep your data safe from unauthorized access or theft.	cyber infrastructure	Use an analogy to explain cyber infrastructure (cybersecurity).
Just as you would have a lock on your front door to prevent people from entering your house without permission, you need cybersecurity measures in place to protect your computer networks and data. These cybersecurity measures can include firewalls, passwords, and anti-virus software. By protecting your cyber infrastructure, you are preventing unauthorized access to your systems and data, which can help keep your information safe from hackers.	cyber infrastructure	Use an analogy to explain cyber infrastructure (cybersecurity).
Cyber infrastructure can be thought of as the backbone of our digital society. Just like our physical infrastructure is essential for running our economy and society, our cyber infrastructure is essential for running our digital economy and society. It's made up of the systems and networks that we use to store, process, and transmit data. And just like with our physical infrastructure, if it's not secure, it can be vulnerable to attack.	cyber infrastructure	Use an analogy to explain cyber infrastructure (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a bank robbery. The robber steals money, but they also steal information (the PIN number, account numbers, etc). This information can be used to commit more crimes in the future.	cyber operations	Use an analogy to explain cyber operations (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity can be thought of as a version of physical security, where the goal is to protect computer networks and systems from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. Just as you might use locks and barriers to keep people out of your home or office, you can use cybersecurity measures to prevent unauthorized access to your computer networks and systems.	cyber operations	Use an analogy to explain cyber operations (cybersecurity).

In the same way, cybersecurity protects your computer networks and data from unauthorized access or theft.	cyber operations	Use an analogy to explain cyber operations (cybersecurity).
Cyber operations are like a lock on your front door. It is there to protect you and your belongings from thieves. In the same way, cyber operations are meant to protect your computer and information from unauthorized access or theft.	cyber operations	Use an analogy to explain cyber operations (cybersecurity).
Cyber operations can be thought of as a lock on a door. The lock is the cyber security measure that is in place to protect the door and its contents. If someone wants to get into the room, they need to have the key (the password) to unlock the door. Similarly, if someone wants to access a computer or network, they need to have the correct login information (password, username, etc.).	cyber operations	Use an analogy to explain cyber operations (cybersecurity).
A cyber operations planner is like a naval commander planning a battle. The planner must consider the enemy's strengths and weaknesses, what resources are available to them, and how best to use those resources to achieve victory. They must also anticipate the enemy's possible responses and plan for those as well.	cyber operations planning	Use an analogy to explain cyber operations planning (cybersecurity).
Cyber operations planning is a bit like planning a military campaign. In order to achieve success, you need to identify your objectives, develop a strategy for achieving those objectives, and then put that plan into action. The same concepts apply in the cyber world. You need to identify your goals (e.g., protecting your organization’s data), create a strategy for reaching those goals (e.g., deploying security tools and personnel), and then implement that plan.	cyber operations planning	Use an analogy to explain cyber operations planning (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is a lot like planning a military operation. In both cases, you have to consider the vulnerabilities of your opponent and plan accordingly. You also need to have a clear goal in mind and make sure all of your resources are aligned towards achieving that goal.	cyber operations planning	Use an analogy to explain cyber operations planning (cybersecurity).
Cyber operations planning is similar to military operations planning. In both cases, planners must identify the objectives of the operation, determine the means by which those objectives can be achieved, and develop a plan for executing the operation. The main difference is that in cyber operations, planners must also take into account the potential effects of their actions on computer systems and networks.	cyber operations planning	Use an analogy to explain cyber operations planning (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like planning a military operation. Just as commanders need to consider the geography of the battlefield, commanders in cyberspace must understand the terrain of the Internet and plan their operations accordingly. They also need to take into account potential threats and vulnerabilities, as well as possible courses of action. Like military planners, cyber defenders must be prepared for any eventuality.	cyber operations planning	Use an analogy to explain cyber operations planning (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like having a lock on your front door. It keeps people from coming into your house without permission. Cybersecurity protects your computer and information the same way a lock on your door protects your home.	cybersecurity	Use an analogy to explain cybersecurity (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like having a lock on your front door. It’s not foolproof, but it makes it more difficult for someone to gain access to your home without permission. Similarly, cybersecurity measures make it harder for hackers to get into your computer or network without authorization.	cybersecurity	Use an analogy to explain cybersecurity (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a wall around a city. The wall protects the city from people who want to harm the citizens. Cybersecurity protects your computer and data from people who want to harm you.	cybersecurity	Use an analogy to explain cybersecurity (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a locked door. You can have the best lock in the world, but if someone has a key they can unlock it. cybersecurity is about making sure you have the best locks and keeping your keys safe.	cybersecurity	Use an analogy to explain cybersecurity (cybersecurity).

Cyberspace is like a big city. There are lots of different people, businesses, and organizations all living in close proximity to one another. As with any city, there are good neighborhoods and bad neighborhoods. The same is true for cyberspace – there are good websites and bad websites. Just as you would take precautions when walking through a dangerous part of town, you need to take precautions when using the internet. You need to be aware of the risks and take steps to protect yourself from cybercrime.	cyberspace	Use an analogy to explain cyberspace (cybersecurity).
Cyberspace can be thought of as a large, open room where people from all over the world can come and communicate with each other. This room is filled with computers, phones, and other devices that allow people to connect to the Internet. While this space is filled with opportunities for communication and collaboration, it also has its risks. Just like in the real world, there are criminals who try to take advantage of people in cyberspace by stealing their information or money. To protect themselves from these criminals, people need to use cybersecurity measures such as passwords and anti-virus software.	cyberspace	Use an analogy to explain cyberspace (cybersecurity).
Cyberspace is like a large room filled with people. While most of the people are paying attention to what is happening around them, there a few people in the back of the room who are actively working on hacking into other people's accounts and stealing their information. As long as you pay attention to what is going on around you and take precautions to protect your information, you will be safe in cyberspace. However, if you let your guard down or don't take the necessary precautions, you could easily become a victim of cybercrime.	cyberspace	Use an analogy to explain cyberspace (cybersecurity).
Cyberspace is a lot like real estate. It's all about location, location, location. The more valuable the property (cybersecurity), the more people want to protect it. Just as people hire security guards to watch over their homes and businesses, they also need hackers to protect their computer networks from attack.	cyberspace	Use an analogy to explain cyberspace (cybersecurity).
Cyberspace can be thought of as a large city. Just like in any city, there are different neighborhoods, each with their own culture and rules. In cyberspace, the neighborhoods are websites, chat rooms, and social media platforms. Each has its own culture and set of rules for how people interact within it.	cyberspace	Use an analogy to explain cyberspace (cybersecurity).
The analogy would be that cyber threat intelligence is like a policeman on the beat. The policeman walks around the neighborhood and observes what is happening, who is doing what, and where potential trouble spots may be. He then relays this information to his fellow officers so they can be aware of what is going on and take steps to prevent crime from happening. In the same way, cti monitors activity online and alerts organizations of potential threats so they can take steps to protect their networks and data.	cyber threat intelligence (cti)	Use an analogy to explain cyber threat intelligence (cti) (cybersecurity).
Cyber threat intelligence can be thought of as the cyber equivalent to a neighborhood watch. A well-run CTI program gathers information on malicious activity in cyberspace, analyzes it for patterns and trends, and shares this information with appropriate stakeholders so they can take action to protect their networks. Just as a Neighborhood Watch helps residents stay alert and aware of criminal activity in their area, CTI helps organizations keep tabs on potential threats to their networks and thwart attacks before they cause damage.	cyber threat intelligence (cti)	Use an analogy to explain cyber threat intelligence (cti) (cybersecurity).
Just as intelligence agencies monitor world events and activities in order to provide warning of potential threats to their nation, cyber threat intelligence (CTI) providers watch the internet for signs of malicious activity that could harm organizations. CTI analysts examine data from a variety of sources—including honeypots, darknets, and open-source information repositories—to identify patterns and indicators of attack. They then share this information with customers in the form of threat reports, which include actionable advice on how to defend against possible attacks.	cyber threat intelligence (cti)	Use an analogy to explain cyber threat intelligence (cti) (cybersecurity).
Cyber Threat intelligence is much like a burglar alarm. It can provide an organization with information on threats to their cyber security posture in the same way that a burglar alarm warns of potential burglars attempting to break into a home or business.	cyber threat intelligence (cti)	Use an analogy to explain cyber threat intelligence (cti) (cybersecurity).
Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is a bit like being able to see the future in that it allows you to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities before they are exploited. CTI gives organizations the ability to stay ahead of attackers by understanding their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs).	cyber threat intelligence (cti)	Use an analogy to explain cyber threat intelligence (cti) (cybersecurity).
Data administration (cybersecurity) is like keeping your house clean. You need to keep all the clutter out of the way so you can find what you are looking for and so it doesn’t get in the way. The same goes for data. It needs to be kept clean and organized so that it is easy to find and use when needed.	data administration	Use an analogy to explain data administration (cybersecurity).
When you are cooking a meal, you need to have the right ingredients in order to make a dish. The same is true when it comes to data administration (cybersecurity). You need to have the right tools and protocols in place in order to protect your data. Just like you would not want someone breaking into your kitchen and stealing your food, you also do not want someone breaking into your computer system and stealing your information. By having strong data administration (cybersecurity) practices in place, you can help ensure that your information is safe and secure.	data administration	Use an analogy to explain data administration (cybersecurity).
Data administration can be likened to the security of a building. Just as you need a locksmith to install and maintain locks on doors to protect your home, you need someone who understands cybersecurity measures to secure your data. Like physical security measures for a building, cyber security safeguards rely on multiple layers of protection that work together to prevent unauthorized access or theft.	data administration	Use an analogy to explain data administration (cybersecurity).
Data administration can be compared to the security of a building. Just as it is important to have strong doors and windows to protect the inhabitants of a building, it is important to have strong cybersecurity measures in place to protect data. Security guards and surveillance cameras can help keep people safe inside a building, while firewalls and antivirus software can help keep data safe from cyberattacks.	data administration	Use an analogy to explain data administration (cybersecurity).
Data administration is like a lock on your front door. It's there to protect your house from thieves. If you have a good lock, the thief will move on to the next house. If you have a bad lock, the thief will rob you blind. Data security is like the alarm system that goes with the lock. It makes sure that if someone does try to break in, they'll get caught.	data administration	Use an analogy to explain data administration (cybersecurity).
Just as the weather report is a compilation of information from different sources (weather stations), cybersecurity data aggregation refers to the gathering of data on cyber threats and incidents from various sources in order to get a comprehensive view. This helps organizations detect and respond to threats more quickly and effectively.	data aggregation	Use an analogy to explain data aggregation (cybersecurity).
Just like a group of birds is called a flock, a group of data points collected together is called an aggregation. In cybersecurity, aggregations are often used to detect malicious activity or unusual patterns. For example, if someone was trying to hack into your network, the aggregated data would show increased traffic from one computer or in one part of the world. By using aggregations, organizations can better protect their systems and networks from potential attacks.	data aggregation	Use an analogy to explain data aggregation (cybersecurity).
One way to think of data aggregation in the cybersecurity context is as if it is bits of information being swept up into a dustbin. Just as with physical garbage, the more and bigger pieces of data that are thrown together, the harder it becomes to sort through them all and identify what’s important. With large volumes of data available for analysis, defenders can be overwhelmed and attackers can find seams in defenses that would not be visible otherwise.	data aggregation	Use an analogy to explain data aggregation (cybersecurity).
Let's say you are a business and have a website. You may have different pages on your website with different levels of security. Your home page may be less secure than the page that stores your customer's credit card information. Data aggregation is like having one big lock to protect all of your pages, regardless of their level of security. This makes it easier for you to manage your security because you only need to worry about one lock instead of several.	data aggregation	Use an analogy to explain data aggregation (cybersecurity).
Data aggregation can be thought of as a cyber security shield. Just as a shield protects you from harm by aggregating many small objects into one larger object, data aggregation helps to protect your computer system by collecting and organizing scattered bits of information into one manageable unit. This makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to hack or steal your data, since they would need to penetrate the shield created by the data aggregation process.	data aggregation	Use an analogy to explain data aggregation (cybersecurity).
A data breach could be analogized to a thief breaking into your home and stealing your personal possessions. Just as you would take measures to protect your possessions by installing a security system, locking doors and windows, and keeping valuables out of sight, you need to take similar precautions to protect your online information. This includes using strong passwords, installing antivirus software, and being vigilant about phishing scams.	data breach	Use an analogy to explain data breach (cybersecurity).
If you think of your computer as a house, the data on it as your possessions, and the internet as the street outside your house, then a data breach would be like someone breaking into your house and stealing your belongings.	data breach	Use an analogy to explain data breach (cybersecurity).
A data breach is like someone breaking into your house and stealing your personal belongings.	data breach	Use an analogy to explain data breach (cybersecurity).
A data breach is not unlike a thief breaking into your home and stealing your possessions. In both cases, the perpetrator is seeking to gain access to something that isn't theirs, with the intent of doing harm. A data breach can be devastating for individuals and businesses alike, as personal information (including passwords) can be used to commit identity theft or other crimes.	data breach	Use an analogy to explain data breach (cybersecurity).
A data breach (cybersecurity) can be analogyized as a bank robbery. In both cases, the assailants are seeking to obtain something of value that is not rightfully theirs. In the case of a data breach, the assailant is seeking to steal information—usually personal information like Social Security numbers or credit card numbers. Just like in a bank robbery, there is usually damage done in addition to the theft itself. A data breach can expose individuals to identity theft and other financial harm.	data breach	Use an analogy to explain data breach (cybersecurity).
Data integrity can be thought of as the cybersecurity equivalent of physical security. Just as it is important to protect your building from unauthorized access, it is important to protect your data from unauthorized access. This means ensuring that only authorized users have access to your data and that the data has not been altered or destroyed.	data integrity	Use an analogy to explain data integrity (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a lock on your door. It keeps unauthorized people from getting into your house, just like cybersecurity keeps unauthorized people from accessing your data.	data integrity	Use an analogy to explain data integrity (cybersecurity).
Data integrity can be thought of as the cybersecurity equivalent of physical fitness. Just as someone who is physically fit is less likely to suffer an injury, someone who practices data integrity (cybersecurity) is less likely to have their information compromised.	data integrity	Use an analogy to explain data integrity (cybersecurity).
A high level of data integrity can be thought of as akin to a safe, secure building. In order for the occupants of the building to feel safe and secure, they need to know that the locks on the doors are effective and that the windows cannot be easily broken. The same is true for data - in order for businesses and individuals to trust it, they need to be confident that it has not been tampered with or compromised in any way. Data integrity protocols help ensure this confidence by verifying the authenticity and accuracy of data at rest and in transit.	data integrity	Use an analogy to explain data integrity (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a wall that surrounds a city. The wall protects the city from intruders and keeps the citizens safe. In the same way, cybersecurity protects your data from intruders and keeps it safe.	data integrity	Use an analogy to explain data integrity (cybersecurity).
A data leak can be best thought of as a water main break. In the same way that gallons of water pour out onto the street, large volumes of sensitive data can escape an organization through a single security hole. And just as city crews must quickly shut off the water and repair the pipe to stop the flow, organizations need to patch vulnerabilities and shore up their defenses to plug leaks and keep their data safe.	data leakage	Use an analogy to explain data leakage (cybersecurity).
Think of data leakage as a thief stealing your most valuable possessions right from under your nose. Just like you would take steps to protect your belongings by locking your doors and windows, you need to take measures to protect your data by using strong passwords and encryption.	data leakage	Use an analogy to explain data leakage (cybersecurity).
Data leakage is similar to a water leak in your home. You may not notice the small drip at first, but it will slowly cause damage over time. The same is true for data leakage – a small amount of information released over time can have a big impact.	data leakage	Use an analogy to explain data leakage (cybersecurity).
Data leakage is like a dam with a small hole in it. The water keeps leaking out until the whole dam eventually collapses. Data breaches are like when someone comes along and deliberately breaks the dam to release all the water.	data leakage	Use an analogy to explain data leakage (cybersecurity).
Picture a container of water with a small hole in the bottom. The water steadily leaks out until the container is empty. This is analogous to data leakage, where confidential or sensitive information gradually seeps out over time, potentially leading to serious security breaches.	data leakage	Use an analogy to explain data leakage (cybersecurity).
When you fill up your car with gasoline, the tank is like a storage area for data. The more gas you put in, the fuller the tank gets. If you keep driving and adding more gas to the tank, it will overflow. Data loss is like this overflowing gas tank; it's when too much data is being stored in one place and it spills over, causing lost or corrupted information.	data loss	Use an analogy to explain data loss (cybersecurity).
If you think of data as being something like water, it's easy to see how losing data can be catastrophic. Just imagine if a flood destroyed your home and all your belongings - that's essentially what happens when data is lost. In the digital world, floods come in the form of cyberattacks, malware, natural disasters, human error and more. And just like with a physical flood, the results can be devastating. Data can be corrupted or erased completely, leading to business shutdowns, financial losses and even loss of life in extreme cases.	data loss	Use an analogy to explain data loss (cybersecurity).
One way to think about data loss is by analogy to a physical fire. A data loss incident may be like a house burning down, with all of the information inside destroyed. Alternatively, it might be more like someone accidentally spilling water on your computer, causing the device to short out and lose all of its data.	data loss	Use an analogy to explain data loss (cybersecurity).
Losing important data is like losing a suitcase filled with all your belongings while on vacation. You may be able to replace some of the items, but you'll never have the same exact set of memories or experiences that you would have if you still had your original luggage.	data loss	Use an analogy to explain data loss (cybersecurity).
Imagine you are at home and have a box of valuable items in your closet. You go to the closet one day and the box is gone - it's been stolen. This is analogous to data loss, where someone has stolen your information from storage (e.g., a computer or server).	data loss	Use an analogy to explain data loss (cybersecurity).
One way of understanding data loss prevention (DLP) is to think of it as a shield that protects your computer from unauthorized access and the theft or destruction of your information. DLP software monitors all activity on your computer, tracking who is accessing which files and transmitting any suspicious behavior to security personnel for further investigation. If someone tries to download or delete important files, DLP will block their actions and alert you so that you can take appropriate steps to protect your data.	data loss prevention	Use an analogy to explain data loss prevention (cybersecurity).
You can think of data loss prevention (DLP) as a cybersecurity umbrella.

Your firewall is like your front door lock, antivirus software is like the alarm system, and intrusion detection systems are like the cameras.	enterprise risk management	Use an analogy to explain enterprise risk management (cybersecurity).
A company is like a ship sailing on the open ocean. The company's officers (CEO, CFO, etc) are at the helm, directing the course of the ship and making decisions about where to travel and what risks to take. Enterprise risk management is like having a system in place that helps these officers make informed decisions about how best to protect their ship from potential threats. Cybersecurity is one important aspect of enterprise risk management, and it involves protecting your systems and data from unauthorized access or theft.	enterprise risk management	Use an analogy to explain enterprise risk management (cybersecurity).
Just as a business needs to have fire insurance in case its building catches on fire, it also needs to have cybersecurity insurance in case its computer systems are hacked. Just as a business might install a smoke detector to help prevent a fire, it might also install antivirus software to help prevent a cyberattack. Enterprise risk management is the process of identifying and addressing these risks so that the business can stay safe online.	enterprise risk management	Use an analogy to explain enterprise risk management (cybersecurity).
Enterprise risk management for cybersecurity is similar to insurance. You hope that you never have to use it, but you're glad it's there if you do. Similarly, you hope your cybersecurity measures never fail, but you're prepared for them to if they do.	enterprise risk management	Use an analogy to explain enterprise risk management (cybersecurity).

Additionally, the consequences of a cybersecurity event can be wide-ranging and devastating.	event	Use an analogy to explain event (cybersecurity).
Exfiltration is the unauthorized transfer of data from a computer system. This can be done in several ways, such as through email, removable storage devices, or networks.	exfiltration	Use an analogy to explain exfiltration (cybersecurity).
Exfiltration is like a thief stealing something from a store. The thief may take small items at first, but eventually they will steal the most valuable item in the store. Exfiltrating data is the same as stealing information from a company. The hacker starts by stealing small bits of information, but eventually they will steal the most sensitive data.	exfiltration	Use an analogy to explain exfiltration (cybersecurity).

The exploit is like someone coming in with a fake ID and getting past the security guard.	exploit	Use an analogy to explain exploit (cybersecurity).
If you think of a computer system as a locked house, the exploit is the key that unlocks the door. An exploit is a piece of software or code that takes advantage of a security vulnerability in order to get access to information or systems that are not supposed to be accessible.	exploit	Use an analogy to explain exploit (cybersecurity).
Exploitation analysis is like a detective investigating a crime. They look for clues to figure out who committed the crime and how they did it. They also look for any weaknesses in the security of the system that could be exploited by criminals.	exploitation analysis	Use an analogy to explain exploitation analysis (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity exploitation analysis is similar to a thief looking for the best way to rob a house. The thief will try different methods and see what works best. cybersecurity analysts do the same thing when trying to exploit vulnerabilities in systems. They test different methods until they find one that works.	exploitation analysis	Use an analogy to explain exploitation analysis (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity exploitation analysis is similar to a thief examining an unsecured building for potential entry points. The analyst searches for vulnerabilities in the system that could be exploited by an attacker. Once these weaknesses are identified, the analyst can recommend security measures to protect the system from unauthorized access.	exploitation analysis	Use an analogy to explain exploitation analysis (cybersecurity).
Exploitation analysis is like a thief looking for the best way to break into a house. They will look for vulnerabilities in the door, windows, and locks to find the easiest way in. Once they have found the weakest spot, they will exploit it to gain access to the house.	exploitation analysis	Use an analogy to explain exploitation analysis (cybersecurity).
Exploitation analysis can be thought of as a process that helps analysts uncover active threats and potential vulnerabilities in their organization's information systems. By identifying these issues, organizations can then take steps to mitigate the risk they pose. The process of exploitation analysis is similar to that of forensic analysis; both involve examining digital evidence in order to identify clues about how an attack was carried out or what vulnerabilities were exploited. However, while forensic analysis is typically used after an attack has occurred, exploitation analysis can be performed proactively in order to help prevent future incidents.	exploitation analysis	Use an analogy to explain exploitation analysis (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is a bit like driving a car. If you don't know how to drive, or if you're not paying attention to the road, you're likely to end up in a ditch. The same goes for cybersecurity - if you're not vigilant about your security practices, and you make mistakes, your network is going to be vulnerable to attack.	failure	Use an analogy to explain failure (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like securing a house. If you have too many windows and doors open, it’s easy for someone to break in. You might be able to secure one door or window well, but if you have 10 doors and windows open, the chances of someone breaking in are much higher. In the same way, if you have weak cybersecurity measures in place, your company is more likely to experience a data breach.	failure	Use an analogy to explain failure (cybersecurity).
A cybersecurity failure could be thought of as a computer system being infected by a virus. The virus may cause the computer to freeze up, or it may steal information from the system.	failure	Use an analogy to explain failure (cybersecurity).
A cybersecurity failure can be likened to a homeowner’s security system not working properly. A home invasion can occur even though the alarm is sounding because it is not stopping the intruder. In a similar way, a cybersecurity breach can happen despite all of your systems being in place because they are not effective in stopping the attack.	failure	Use an analogy to explain failure (cybersecurity).
If you think of cybersecurity as a building, then a breach in security would be like someone breaking into the building. Attackers may try to gain access by exploiting vulnerabilities in the system or by tricking users into divulging their passwords. Once inside, they could steal data or damage critical systems.	failure	Use an analogy to explain failure (cybersecurity).
A firewall can be thought of as a physical wall that separates one room in a house from another. The firewall prevents people from passing between the rooms without permission.

For example, imagine that you have collected a bunch of unique items (e.g., toy cars, baseball cards, etc.) and placed them into a large cardboard box. You then take a picture of the contents of the box from above so that everything is in view and create an image file called “box-photo.jpg”. If someone else wants to know what is in your box, they can open the photo file and see all of the items pictured inside it—no need to actually open the physical container!Now let’s say that you decide to add a new toy car to your collection and want to include it in the photo. To do this, you would take another picture of the contents of the box (including the new car) and save it as “box-updated.jpg”. The updated photo would then contain two images: one showing all of the original items and one showing just the new addition. In order to verify that no other changes were made to either photograph since they were taken, you could calculate a hash value for each file using some hashing algorithm like SHA256 or MD5 . If both hashes match, then you can be confident that neither image has been altered since it was created.**Please note: This is a very simplified explanation of how hash values work!	hash value	Use an analogy to explain hash value (cybersecurity).
Hashing is like a fingerprint of a file. It is a unique, cryptographic representation of the contents of that file. If two files have the same hash value, it means they are identical in content.	hash value	Use an analogy to explain hash value (cybersecurity).
Hash value can be explained as similar to a fingerprint. Just as each person has a unique fingerprint, every piece of data has its own unique hash value. When you want to verify the identity of someone, you compare their fingerprint against the one on file. The same is true for data; when you want to ensure that the information hasn’t been tampered with, you can compare the hash values to make sure they match.	hash value	Use an analogy to explain hash value (cybersecurity).
Just as a fingerprint is unique to an individual, a hash value is unique for each document or file. A hash function takes a variable-length input and produces a fixed-length output by combining the bits of the input in such a way that it is impossible to recreate the original input from the output. The result of hashing a given file will be different every time, even if two files are identical bit-for-bit. This makes hashes useful for identifying specific files, as well as verifying their integrity—if the contents of two files have been changed, their hashes will not match.	hash value	Use an analogy to explain hash value (cybersecurity).
A hash value is like a fingerprint. It's unique to each file and can be used to verify its authenticity.	hash value	Use an analogy to explain hash value (cybersecurity).
Hashing is a bit like using a random number generator to create a long, unique string of numbers and letters. Just as importantly, it's like taking that long string and turning it into an easily readable word or phrase. So if you ever need to remember your password, you can think of the easily-remembered phrase rather than the actual characters.	hashing	Use an analogy to explain hashing (cybersecurity).
Hashing is like a safety deposit box at the bank. The bank keeps your key to the box, and if you ever need access to your items in the box, they will use their own key to open it for you. Hashing is similar because it takes an input (like your name) and creates a unique output (a hash). If someone ever needs to verify that your name is indeed associated with the hash, they can use the same hashing algorithm to create their own hash of your name and compare it to the one that you provided.	hashing	Use an analogy to explain hashing (cybersecurity).
Hashing is like a fingerprint for data. It is a unique representation of information that can be used to identify whether or not something has been tampered with. When you hash data, it creates a fixed-length string of characters that can be used as an identifier for the original data. If the data is changed in any way, the hash will also change. This makes it easy to compare hashes to ensure that the original data has not been compromised.	hashing	Use an analogy to explain hashing (cybersecurity).
Hashing can be thought of as similar to a postal service. When you send a letter, the post office puts a unique stamp on it so that it can be tracked and sorted. When someone receives the letter, they can look at the stamp to see where it came from and who sent it. Hashing functions work in a similar way. They take an input (like a password) and turn it into a unique hash value that can be used to track the item. If someone tries to change the input, they will also change the hash value, which will alert others that something is not right.	hashing	Use an analogy to explain hashing (cybersecurity).
Hashing is a bit like the post office. When you send a letter, the postal service assigns it a unique tracking number, which helps them keep track of it as it travels to its destination. Hashing does something similar for data: it assigns each piece of information a unique identifier that allows you to keep track of it as it moves through cyberspace.	hashing	Use an analogy to explain hashing (cybersecurity).
Hazard is like a car accident. Just as you can't predict when or where a car accident will happen, you also can't predict when or where a cyberattack will occur.	hazard	Use an analogy to explain hazard (cybersecurity).
Hazard is like a fire. It can cause a lot of damage if it isn't put out quickly.	hazard	Use an analogy to explain hazard (cybersecurity).
Hazard can be likened to a home security system. The homeowner takes measures to protect their house (install a security alarm, use deadbolts, etc.), in order to reduce the risk of being burglarized. Similarly, individuals and organizations take steps to protect their computer networks and data (use firewalls, install antivirus software, etc.), in order to reduce the risk of being hacked.	hazard	Use an analogy to explain hazard (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is a hazard like a hazardous material. It can be dangerous to people and the environment if not handled or disposed of properly.	hazard	Use an analogy to explain hazard (cybersecurity).
Hazard is like a house fire. It is something that can cause harm if not properly mitigated.	hazard	Use an analogy to explain hazard (cybersecurity).
If you think of the internet as a road, then data is the traffic that travels on it. And just like with real-world roads, there are all sorts of threats to internet traffic — from accidents and weather events to terrorism and cyberattacks. In the world of cybersecurity, these threats are referred to as ict supply chain threats.Just like with physical infrastructure such as bridges and tunnels, our digital infrastructure is also vulnerable to attack. Hackers can target systems directly, or they can go after suppliers and service providers in an attempt to gain access to networks further down the line. This is known as a supply chain attack, and it’s one of the most common types of cyberattack.	ict supply chain threat	Use an analogy to explain ict supply chain threat (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity threats in the ict supply chain are like a virus that can spread quickly and easily throughout an organization, compromising data and systems. Just as businesses have to take precautions to protect their physical supply chains from theft or damage, they also need to secure their digital supply chains against cyberattacks.	ict supply chain threat	Use an analogy to explain ict supply chain threat (cybersecurity).
A cyber breach in the supply chain is like a break in the water main. It can interrupt service to customers and cause significant financial damage.	ict supply chain threat	Use an analogy to explain ict supply chain threat (cybersecurity).
A cyber breach in the supply chain could be analogous to a hole in the hull of a ship. Just as water can enter the ship and cause it to sink, malicious actors could exploit vulnerabilities in the supply chain to gain access to systems and steal or damage data. This could have serious consequences for businesses and organizations, including financial losses, compromised data, and decreased efficiency.	ict supply chain threat	Use an analogy to explain ict supply chain threat (cybersecurity).
The ICT supply chain could be thought of as being similar to the food supply chain. Just as businesses need to ensure that their food is sourced from reputable suppliers and that it is stored and transported in a safe manner, organisations must do the same when it comes to their ICT systems and data. If cybercriminals are able to penetrate the defences of a business’s ICT supplier, they could gain access to sensitive information or install malware that would give them control over these systems.	ict supply chain threat	Use an analogy to explain ict supply chain threat (cybersecurity).
When you go out in public, you wear a name badge that identifies who you are. This allows people to know who you are and allows you to access certain areas or facilities. Access management is like this name badge system, except it applies to computers and networks instead of people. Identity management is the process of creating and managing user identities, while access management is the process of controlling which users have access to which resources on a computer or network.	identity and access management	Use an analogy to explain identity and access management (cybersecurity).
If you think of identity and access management like a door, the identity is the person who wants to enter and the access management is what allows them to open the door. The identity could be a key or it could be a password, but either way, it's something that needs to be authenticated in order to gain access.	identity and access management	Use an analogy to explain identity and access management (cybersecurity).
Identity and access management is like a bouncer at a club. The bouncer has the identity of everyone who is allowed into the club, as well as the access privileges for each person. The bouncer also keeps track of who is in the club and what they are doing.	identity and access management	Use an analogy to explain identity and access management (cybersecurity).
Identity and access management can be compared to a keychain. Each key on the keychain corresponds to a door that can be opened. The keychain is only valuable if you have the right keys to open the doors you want to enter. Identity and access management is similar in that it allows organizations to control which users have access to which resources.	identity and access management	Use an analogy to explain identity and access management (cybersecurity).
Identity and access management is like a key to your home. You need to have the key in order to get into your house. Similarly, you need login credentials (username and password) in order to access your computer or network account. Identity and access management systems ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data and systems.	identity and access management	Use an analogy to explain identity and access management (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like an airport security checkpoint. The goal is to keep bad things from happening by screening everyone and everything that comes through. Cybersecurity works the same way - it screens all incoming and outgoing traffic for malicious or unauthorized activity.	impact	Use an analogy to explain impact (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a lock on your front door. It helps to keep unwanted individuals out of your house. Similarly, cybersecurity protects your computer networks from unauthorized access and intrusion.	impact	Use an analogy to explain impact (cybersecurity).
One way to think about the impact of cyberattacks is to compare them to physical attacks. A physical attack can have a devastating impact on people, property, and businesses. The same is true for cyberattacks. A successful cyberattack can cause extensive damage by destroying or stealing data, disrupting business operations, or even compromising the security of critical infrastructure.	impact	Use an analogy to explain impact (cybersecurity).
The impact of a cyber breach is similar to the impact of a physical break-in. A cyber breach can compromise confidential information, lead to financial losses, and damage your company’s reputation.	impact	Use an analogy to explain impact (cybersecurity).
If you think of your computer as a house, the firewall is like a sturdy metal door that protects the inside of your house from people on the outside. It keeps them out and only lets authorized people in. A good firewall also monitors traffic going in and out to make sure nothing suspicious is happening.	impact	Use an analogy to explain impact (cybersecurity).
A cyber breach can be best analogy to a home invasion. Just like when someone breaks into your house and steals your belongings, a hacker can gain access to your computer systems and steal or damage your data. The results can be devastating, costing you time, money and even jeopardizing the security of your personal information.	incident	Use an analogy to explain incident (cybersecurity).
A cyberattack can be seen as a burglary. Just like when someone breaks into your home, they are attempting to steal something, in a cyberattack, the hacker is trying to steal information.	incident	Use an analogy to explain incident (cybersecurity).
If you think of your computer as a house, the firewall would be like a big brick wall in front of the house that keeps people from being able to get in. The firewall is there to protect your computer from unauthorized access and keep it secure.	incident	Use an analogy to explain incident (cybersecurity).
The incident could be best described as a cybersecurity event. Just like when you have an incident in the physical world, such as a fire or theft, a cybersecurity event is something that happens in the digital world that can have negative consequences. In this case, the hacker was able to gain access to the company's computer system and steal confidential information.	incident	Use an analogy to explain incident (cybersecurity).
I think of a cybersecurity incident as being like a home invasion. Your computer is the house, and the bad guys are trying to get in through the windows (via vulnerable software) or doors (via weak passwords). You want to make sure you have good security measures in place so that your house is as protected as possible from these invaders.	incident	Use an analogy to explain incident (cybersecurity).
 Incident management is like a fire drill. You have to be prepared for when something happens so you know how to react quickly and effectively.	incident management	Use an analogy to explain incident management (cybersecurity).
If you think of cybersecurity as a building, then incident management would be the fire department. Incident management is responsible for responding to and resolving incidents that occur in the cybersecurity "building". They work to identify and contain threats, restore systems and services, and protect the organization's data.	incident management	Use an analogy to explain incident management (cybersecurity).
Incident management is like a fire drill. Just as you would have a plan for what to do if there was a fire in your school, office or home, you need a plan for how you will respond to cyber incidents. The goal of incident management is to minimize the damage caused by an attack and restore normal operations as quickly as possible.	incident management	Use an analogy to explain incident management (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity incident management is like cooking a meal. You have to start with the right ingredients, follow a recipe, and be patient while it cooks. If you are not careful, you might ruin the dish.	incident management	Use an analogy to explain incident management (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is a lot like emergency response planning for an organization. Just as there are plans in place for what to do if there is a fire, flood, or other disaster, organizations need to have plans in place for how they will respond to a cyber incident. The goal of Incident Management (IM) is to ensure that the organization responds quickly and effectively to any cyber incidents that occur. This includes preventing the incident from spreading and minimizing the damage it causes.	incident management	Use an analogy to explain incident management (cybersecurity).
A response plan for a cyber incident is like having a fire drill at school. You have a plan in place, everyone knows what to do, and you can execute the plan quickly if needed.	incident response	Use an analogy to explain incident response (cybersecurity).
A good analogy for incident response in cybersecurity would be to think of it as being similar to a fire drill. In the event of a real fire, everyone knows what to do and where to go because they have practiced it before. The same is true for cybersecurity incidents–if you have planned and rehearsed your response, then you will know exactly what to do when (and if) an incident occurs.	incident response	Use an analogy to explain incident response (cybersecurity).
When your car is in for a service, the mechanics will take a look at the whole car and try to fix any problems they see. They may not be able to fix everything straight away, but they'll make a note of what needs doing and how much it's likely to cost. Then, when you come to pick up your car, they'll have fixed as many things as they could and given you an estimate of how much it will cost to finish the job.This is pretty similar to how incident response works in cybersecurity. The first step is always detection - finding out that something has gone wrong and trying to work out what it is. Once you know what the problem is, you can start working on fixing it. This might involve shutting down parts of the network, removing infected files or blocking certain IP addresses. You'll also need to figure out who was behind the attack so you can take steps to protect yourself from them in future.	incident response	Use an analogy to explain incident response (cybersecurity).
If you think of a cyber breach as an incident, then the response would be analogous to the emergency responders who come to deal with the scene. Just like in the physical world, there is a need for first responders (e.g., police, firefighters) who are skilled in dealing with different types of emergencies. In the cybersecurity world, there is a similar need for experts who can quickly identify and respond to incidents.	incident response	Use an analogy to explain incident response (cybersecurity).
When you have a fire in your house, you don't just sit there and hope it will go out. You take action to put the fire out. The same is true with cybersecurity incidents. When you detect an incident, you need to take action to mitigate the damage and protect your organization.	incident response	Use an analogy to explain incident response (cybersecurity).
A cyber incident response plan is like a fire drill. Everyone knows their role and what to do in the event of an emergency. In the same way, everyone who participates in your organization's cybersecurity should know their role in responding to a cyber incident. Having a well-rehearsed plan will help you respond quickly and effectively if (or when) an incident occurs.	incident response plan	Use an analogy to explain incident response plan (cybersecurity).
A cybersecurity incident response plan can be thought of as a fire evacuation plan. Just like there are steps that need to be taken in order to ensure everyone is safe during a fire, there are also specific steps that need to be followed in order to protect your computer systems and data from harm during a cybersecurity incident.	incident response plan	Use an analogy to explain incident response plan (cybersecurity).
A cybersecurity incident response plan is like a disaster recovery plan. It is a set of written instructions that help an organization respond to and recover from a cyberattack. The plan includes steps for detecting and responding to attacks, protecting data and systems, restoring service, and investigating the attack.	incident response plan	Use an analogy to explain incident response plan (cybersecurity).
The Incident Response Plan (IRP) is like a guidebook on how to respond when your car is in a collision. The plan outlines what steps should be taken to minimize the damage and protect yourself and other drivers. In the same way, the IRP for cybersecurity lays out a step-by-step process for responding to cyber incidents such as data breaches, malicious software attacks, or network intrusions. By having a written plan in place, you can speed up the response time and reduce the impact of an attack.	incident response plan	Use an analogy to explain incident response plan (cybersecurity).
A cybersecurity incident response plan can be thought of as a fire evacuation plan. Just as every business should have a plan in place for how to evacuate their employees in the event of a fire, they should also have a plan in place for how to respond to and recover from a cyberattack. The goal of both plans is to ensure that everyone is safe and that the business can resume operations as quickly as possible.	incident response plan	Use an analogy to explain incident response plan (cybersecurity).
One analogy for indicator (cybersecurity) is the use of a seat belt in a car. A seat belt is an indicator that tells the driver and passengers that they should buckle up. In the same way, indicators in cybersecurity tell users when they need to take action to protect their systems and data.	indicator	Use an analogy to explain indicator (cybersecurity).
Some people use indicator as a metaphor for early warning signs of an attack. Just like in the natural world, indicators can be things like increased vehicle activity at a border crossing or higher call volumes to customer service centers. In the digital world, these could be things like large spikes in login attempts or unusually high email traffic.	indicator	Use an analogy to explain indicator (cybersecurity).
An indicator is a warning sign that something bad may happen. For example, if you see a lot of cars parked in the emergency lane on the side of the highway, it might be an indication that there was an accident ahead and traffic is backed up. Similarly, if your computer starts acting strange or you get messages from friends saying your account has been hacked, these could be indicators that someone is trying to steal your information.	indicator	Use an analogy to explain indicator (cybersecurity).
A cyber security indicator is like a traffic light. The color of the light (red, yellow, and green) corresponds to the severity of the threat. Red means that there is an immediate risk and action must be taken; yellow means that there is a potential risk and further assessment is required; and green means that there is little or no risk.	indicator	Use an analogy to explain indicator (cybersecurity).
An indicator is something that points to the existence of a potential problem or risk. In cybersecurity, indicators can be things like strange activity on your network, unusual email attachments, or downloads from suspicious websites. Knowing what these indicators look like and how to respond to them is an important part of keeping your organization's data safe.	indicator	Use an analogy to explain indicator (cybersecurity).
A cyberattack on an industrial control system (ICS) is like a break-in at a nuclear power plant. Once malicious actors are in, they can do whatever they want within the systems they have compromised. They could steal or damage data, equipment, or even injure people. The consequences of such an attack could be disastrous.	industrial control system	Use an analogy to explain industrial control system (cybersecurity).
When you leave your house, you lock the door to ensure that no one can enter without your permission. Industrial control systems are like this - they use security measures (like passwords and firewalls) to keep unauthorized users out.	industrial control system	Use an analogy to explain industrial control system (cybersecurity).
Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are the cyber-equivalent of a cockpit in an airplane. They are used to monitor and control critical industrial processes, such as those that produce electricity, oil and gas, chemicals, and water. ICSs have been increasingly targeted by malicious actors for their potential to cause physical damage and massive economic impact. Just like airline pilots need access to cockpits to fly planes safely, operators of ICSs require secure access to these systems to ensure that plant operations remain safe and reliable.	industrial control system	Use an analogy to explain industrial control system (cybersecurity).
An industrial control system is like a car. The computer in the car is the controller and it controls things like the engine, brakes, and steering. If someone were to hack into the computer in the car, they could take control of these systems and potentially cause accidents. Industrial control systems are vulnerable to cyberattacks because they use outdated software and operate on networks that are open to attack.	industrial control system	Use an analogy to explain industrial control system (cybersecurity).
An industrial control system (ICS) is like a car. It has various systems that need to work together in order for it to function properly. If one of the systems is not working right, it can cause the entire car to break down. The same goes for an ICS - if there is a security breach in one of the systems, it could cause the whole ICS to fail.	industrial control system	Use an analogy to explain industrial control system (cybersecurity).
The internet can be thought of as a giant city. Within this city are all sorts of people and businesses, each with their own individual goals and purposes. However, in order for the city to function smoothly, everyone needs to be able to communicate with one another. Similarly, in order for the internet to work properly, we need to have systems in place that allow us to safely send and receive information between users. Cybersecurity is what keeps our information protected within this system, just like law enforcement ensures public safety within a real city.	information and communication(s) technology	Use an analogy to explain information and communication(s) technology (cybersecurity).
Information and communication technology (ICT) can be compared to the human body's nervous system. The brain is like the central processing unit, sending commands to different parts of the body to make it move. ICT works in a similar way, with computers communicating with each other over a network. Just as our bodies have defences against foreign invaders (such as bacteria), so too do computer networks have defences against hackers and cybercrime.	information and communication(s) technology	Use an analogy to explain information and communication(s) technology (cybersecurity).
Information and communication technology can be thought of as the highways that information travels on. Just as there are many different types of roads (e.g., interstate, highway, county road), information takes many different forms (email, text message, video call). And just as it is important to make sure that our highways are safe for drivers (by installing guardrails and speed limits, for example), it is important to make sure our cyber infrastructure is safe by implementing cybersecurity measures.	information and communication(s) technology	Use an analogy to explain information and communication(s) technology (cybersecurity).
An analogy for information and communication technology (cybersecurity) would be the security of a building. Just as you would install a lock on your door to secure your home, you need to have cybersecurity measures in place to protect your computer networks and data. These measures might include firewalls, anti-virus software, and user authentication procedures.	information and communication(s) technology	Use an analogy to explain information and communication(s) technology (cybersecurity).
Just as locks are used to protect physical property, cybersecurity is used to protect digital property. Locks can be opened with a key, and information can be accessed with a password. However, if the key or password is lost or stolen, the lock or information can be compromised.	information and communication(s) technology	Use an analogy to explain information and communication(s) technology (cybersecurity).
Like the locks on your front door, information assurance (cybersecurity) is what protects your data from unauthorized access. Just as you would need a key to unlock your door, you need special credentials (e.g., username and password) to access your data. Information assurance (cybersecurity) also includes measures like firewalls and antivirus software that help keep intruders out of your network.	information assurance	Use an analogy to explain information assurance (cybersecurity).
Information assurance can be thought of as a cyber fortress. Just like a real fortress, the goal is to protect the inhabitants (in this case, information) from harm while still allowing access to those who need it. To do this, you need strong walls (firewalls), reliable defenses (anti-virus software), and guards who are constantly watching for any sign of danger.	information assurance	Use an analogy to explain information assurance (cybersecurity).
Information assurance (cybersecurity) can be thought of as similar to a locked door. The door is locked to keep unauthorized individuals out, and the lock is there to ensure the security of the contents inside. In the same way, information assurance (cybersecurity) protects against unauthorized access and ensures the security of data and systems.	information assurance	Use an analogy to explain information assurance (cybersecurity).
Information assurance can be thought of as the cybersecurity of a building. Just as you would take measures to protect your home from thieves, you need to take steps to protect your online information. This includes using strong passwords, installing malware protection software, and being careful what links you click on.	information assurance	Use an analogy to explain information assurance (cybersecurity).
Just as you would lock your door at night to protect your home and family, you need to take measures to protect your information online. This includes using strong passwords, anti-virus software, and firewalls.	information assurance	Use an analogy to explain information assurance (cybersecurity).
Information assurance compliance is like locking your car doors when you leave it parked on the street. You are taking a proactive step to secure your vehicle from potential theft. Similarly, information assurance compliance protects your company's data from cyber-attacks by implementing security measures that deter unauthorized access and protect against data loss or corruption.	information assurance compliance	Use an analogy to explain information assurance compliance (cybersecurity).
One analogy for information assurance compliance (cybersecurity) is locking your car doors. You may have a great car, but if you don’t lock the doors, anyone can get in and take it. Locking your car doors protects your investment and keeps you safe while you’re driving. Information assurance compliance (cybersecurity) is similar – by implementing security measures such as firewalls and passwords, you are protecting your company’s data from unauthorized access or theft.	information assurance compliance	Use an analogy to explain information assurance compliance (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a lock on your front door. You may have the best lock in the world, but if you don't use it, it's not going to do you any good. The same is true for cybersecurity; you need to have protocols and processes in place to protect your data from unauthorized access.	information assurance compliance	Use an analogy to explain information assurance compliance (cybersecurity).
One analogy for information assurance compliance (cybersecurity) is the security of a bank. A bank has various levels of security, from the front door to the vault. The employees must have identification badges and are only allowed in certain areas. There are cameras throughout the building and alarms that go off if someone breaks in. The bank also has policies and procedures that must be followed by both employees and customers. If someone tries to rob the bank, they will likely be caught on camera or get into a physical altercation with an employee, which will trigger the alarm.	information assurance compliance	Use an analogy to explain information assurance compliance (cybersecurity).
Information assurance compliance (cybersecurity) is like locking your door at night. You may not think you need to do it, but if you don't, you're opening yourself up to potential theft or harm. Compliance with information assurance standards is a way of protecting yourself and your data from harm.	information assurance compliance	Use an analogy to explain information assurance compliance (cybersecurity).
A cybersecurity policy can be thought of as a set of traffic rules for the internet. Just as drivers need to obey traffic laws in order to keep everyone safe on the road, computer users need to obey cybersecurity laws in order to keep everyone safe online. Cybersecurity policies help protect your computer and information by setting rules for using the internet, such as password requirements and restrictions on which websites can be visited.	information security policy	Use an analogy to explain information security policy (cybersecurity).
Information security policy can be thought of as the locks on your house. The locks are there to keep people out who don't belong in your house, and more importantly, to protect your belongings inside. Information security policy is like that - it's a set of rules that help protect your information from unauthorized access or theft.	information security policy	Use an analogy to explain information security policy (cybersecurity).
A cybersecurity policy can be thought of as a set of rules that dictate how an organization will protect its computer systems and data from unauthorized access or theft. Just as drivers must obey traffic laws in order to keep the roads safe, employees must follow the organization's cybersecurity policy in order to protect the company's computer systems and data.	information security policy	Use an analogy to explain information security policy (cybersecurity).
A company's information security policy (cybersecurity) is like a building's fire alarm system. The policy is in place to protect the company's data from unauthorized access or theft, just as the fire alarm system is in place to protect people and property from a fire. Like the fire alarm system, the information security policy must be regularly maintained and updated to ensure that it remains effective.	information security policy	Use an analogy to explain information security policy (cybersecurity).
Information security policy can be compared to the locks on your doors. The locks keep people from entering your house without permission, and they also deter burglars by making it more difficult for them to get into your home. Similarly, information security policies make it more difficult for hackers to access your data, and they also help you track who is accessing your information.	information security policy	Use an analogy to explain information security policy (cybersecurity).
Information sharing can be best explained as if it was an office. In order for the office to run smoothly, everyone needs to have access to the same information. If one person is working on a project and they need information that is stored in another person's computer, they need to be able to access that computer in order to get the information they need. The same concept applies to cybersecurity. In order for a company's cybersecurity strategy to be effective, all of the employees within the company need to have access to the same information. This includes having access to updates about new cyber threats and being aware of how the company's security measures are currently implemented.	information sharing	Use an analogy to explain information sharing (cybersecurity).
If you think of your computer as a locked room, with the key hidden somewhere in the room, information sharing is like telling someone where to find the key. It makes it easier for people who need access to your information to get it, without having to search all over the place for the key.	information sharing	Use an analogy to explain information sharing (cybersecurity).
Information sharing is like a big group of people coming together to discuss important topics. By pooling their knowledge and resources, they are able to come up with better solutions that benefit everyone involved. In the same way, information sharing (cybersecurity) allows businesses and organizations to come together and share ideas and strategies for keeping their data safe. This helps create a stronger defense against cyber attacks, and ultimately keeps everyone's information more secure.	information sharing	Use an analogy to explain information sharing (cybersecurity).
If you think of cybersecurity as a city, then the walls and gates around the city are like the security measures that protect the perimeter of a network. The people in the city are like the data inside the network. The businesses and residents in the city need to be able to share information with each other in order to function efficiently. However, they also need to be protected from outsiders who might want to steal their information or damage their systems. Just like a real city, cybersecurity requires both defense and communication.	information sharing	Use an analogy to explain information sharing (cybersecurity).
If you think of cybersecurity as a highway, then information sharing is the traffic light system that helps keep everyone safe. By sharing information about threats and vulnerabilities, businesses and organizations can work together to protect themselves from attacks.	information sharing	Use an analogy to explain information sharing (cybersecurity).
If you think of a city, the various systems that make it work (power, water, transportation, etc.) are analogous to an organization's information systems. Just as it is important for cities to have multiple redundancies in their critical systems to ensure resilience in the event of a failure, organizations need to have multiple redundancies in their information systems infrastructure to ensure resilience against cyberattacks.	information system resilience	Use an analogy to explain information system resilience (cybersecurity).
A house with a strong foundation is resilient to wind and weather. Similarly, a cyber-secure information system has a strong foundation in security controls that can resist attack and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and systems.	information system resilience	Use an analogy to explain information system resilience (cybersecurity).
A cyberattack on an information system could be compared to a hurricane damaging a city. Just as the citizens of a city need to take measures to ensure their safety before, during, and after a hurricane, organizations need to take steps to ensure the security of their systems before, during, and after a cyberattack.	information system resilience	Use an analogy to explain information system resilience (cybersecurity).
An information system (IS) is like a human body. Just as the human body has systems that protect it from disease and other health risks, an IS has systems that protect it from cybersecurity threats. These systems work together to create resilience for the IS. Just as the human body can withstand some amount of damage and still function, an IS can withstand some amount of cyberattacks and still function. However, if too much damage is inflicted on either the human body or an IS, they will not be able to recover completely.	information system resilience	Use an analogy to explain information system resilience (cybersecurity).
A cyberattack against a company can be thought of as an attack against its computer systems. Just like a physical attack against a building can cause damage and make it more difficult for the business to operate, a cyberattack can do the same thing by disabling or disrupting computer systems. A company’s information system resilience (cybersecurity) is its ability to protect its computer systems from such attacks and to quickly restore normal operations if they occur.	information system resilience	Use an analogy to explain information system resilience (cybersecurity).
Just as the police department patrols the city to keep people safe and enforce the law, a cybersecurity operations team (cybersecurity) monitors and defends an organization's information systems against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction. The goal of both is to protect their respective populations from harm.	information systems security operations	Use an analogy to explain information systems security operations (cybersecurity).
Information security operations can be thought of as a fortress with walls, gates, and guards. The walls protect the fortress from outsiders, while the gates allow people and goods to enter and leave. The guards are responsible for ensuring that only authorized people are allowed inside and that everyone who enters is safe. In the same way, information systems security operations protect an organization's computer systems from unauthorized access and ensure that all data passing through those systems is safe.	information systems security operations	Use an analogy to explain information systems security operations (cybersecurity).
Just as people might install locks and security alarms in their homes to protect their possessions, organizations install cyber security measures to protect their information. Security operations teams monitor the organization's systems for signs of intrusion or attack, and they take action to thwart any attempted breaches. They also work to ensure that users follow safe practices when accessing or using data, and that the organization's networks are secure from unauthorized access.	information systems security operations	Use an analogy to explain information systems security operations (cybersecurity).
A cyber-attack is like a burglary. An attacker breaks into your home and steals your possessions. A security incident response plan is like having a security alarm system that goes off when the burglar enters your home. The response team investigates the alarm, determines what happened, and takes steps to fix the problem and protect your home from future burglaries.	information systems security operations	Use an analogy to explain information systems security operations (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is a bit like locking your front door. You may have a strong lock and sturdy frame, but if you don't use it, someone could easily enter your house. The same is true for cybersecurity - you need to have the right security measures in place and use them regularly to keep your data safe from cybercriminals.	information systems security operations	Use an analogy to explain information systems security operations (cybersecurity).
When you think about cybersecurity, it is similar to locking your car. You are taking preventative measures to ensure that someone cannot steal or damage your car. Cybersecurity is the same way; you are protecting your computer and information from being stolen or damaged.	information technology	Use an analogy to explain information technology (cybersecurity).
If information technology is the internet, then cybersecurity would be the locks on your doors and windows. It's important to have good locks on your doors and windows so that people can't just walk into your house without your permission. The same thing is true with the internet. You want to make sure that you have strong cybersecurity measures in place so that people can't just walk into your computer without your permission.	information technology	Use an analogy to explain information technology (cybersecurity).
Just as you would lock your front door to keep criminals from entering your house, you need cybersecurity measures in place to protect your computer and data from unauthorized access.	information technology	Use an analogy to explain information technology (cybersecurity).
Just as locks are used to protect your home, cybersecurity measures are used to protect your computer and information. Cybersecurity measures work like a lock on your front door, preventing unauthorized individuals from accessing your house and the belongings inside.	information technology	Use an analogy to explain information technology (cybersecurity).
A computer is like a car. Cars need oil changes and tune-ups to run well, just like computers need security updates and malware protection to stay safe.	information technology	Use an analogy to explain information technology (cybersecurity).
Inside (r) threats are like a thief that steals something from you when you are home. They are people or programs that have access to your computer and network, and they use this access to steal information or damage your systems. These threats can be difficult to detect because they often use legitimate credentials to gain access to your data.	inside( r) threat	Use an analogy to explain inside( r) threat (cybersecurity).
If someone is physically inside your home, they are a threat to your safety. If someone is inside your computer network, they are a threat to your cybersecurity.	inside( r) threat	Use an analogy to explain inside( r) threat (cybersecurity).
Inside threat is like a thief breaking into your home. They may have inside information on how your security works and how to get around it, allowing them access to your most sensitive data and possessions.	inside( r) threat	Use an analogy to explain inside( r) threat (cybersecurity).
Inside threat (cybersecurity) is like someone breaking into your house through a window while you are home. They may try to steal your belongings or hurt you.	inside( r) threat	Use an analogy to explain inside( r) threat (cybersecurity).
A cyberattack can be thought of as someone breaking into your house through a window. Once they are in, they can steal your possessions, damage your property, or even harm you and your family.	inside( r) threat	Use an analogy to explain inside( r) threat (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a castle with walls, a moat, and a drawbridge. The walls are the security perimeter of the network, the moat is the firewall that protects it from intruders, and the drawbridge is the authentication process that allows access only to authorized users.	integrated risk management	Use an analogy to explain integrated risk management (cybersecurity).
Integrated risk management is like a car. The car has many different parts that work together to make it go. If one part of the car doesn't work, the whole car won't work. Cybersecurity is like the brakes on the car. If the brakes don't work, the car will crash.	integrated risk management	Use an analogy to explain integrated risk management (cybersecurity).
Integrated risk management can be thought of as a “cybersecurity umbrella.” Just like an umbrella protects you from the rain, integrated risk management protects your organization from cyber threats. By integrating different aspects of cybersecurity into a cohesive whole, you can develop a more holistic approach to managing your risk and vulnerabilities. This helps ensure that no single vulnerability goes undetected or unmitigated.	integrated risk management	Use an analogy to explain integrated risk management (cybersecurity).
A good analogy for integrated risk management would be to think of it as a home security system. A home security system has multiple layers of protection, including: door and window alarms, cameras, motion detectors, and a security guard. If someone tries to break into the home through a window, the alarm will go off and the security guard will be alerted. If someone tries to enter through the front door when the alarm is on, they will be confronted by the security guard. The same concept applies to integrated risk management; having multiple layers of protection (including people, processes, and technology) helps to protect an organization from cyber threats.	integrated risk management	Use an analogy to explain integrated risk management (cybersecurity).
Risk management can be thought of as a layered defense in which different layers provide different types of protection. The first line of defense is the perimeter security, which is designed to keep unauthorized users out. If someone does get past the perimeter, they would then encounter the next layer of security, which might include intrusion detection systems and firewalls. If they managed to penetrate that layer, they would then face the final line of defense –the end user. This analogy can be used to explain integrated risk management (cybersecurity). In this case, the perimeter security would represent basic cybersecurity measures such as anti-virus software and firewalls. The second layer would represent more sophisticated measures such as intrusion detection systems and data loss prevention systems. And finally, the end user would represent people who are trained to recognize phishing attacks and other forms of social engineering	integrated risk management	Use an analogy to explain integrated risk management (cybersecurity).
Integrity can be thought of as the cybersecurity equivalent of a "glass jaw." Just as a boxer with a glass jaw is at risk of being knocked out with even a glancing blow, so too is your organization vulnerable to cyberattacks if it lacks integrity. Cybercriminals only have to find one weak spot in your defenses to exploit and they can quickly gain access to your systems and data. By contrast, organizations that maintain high levels of integrity are much more difficult (if not impossible) for hackers to penetrate.	integrity	Use an analogy to explain integrity (cybersecurity).
Integrity is the cyber equivalent of a bank's balance sheet. It is a measure of how much data has been changed or added since it was last verified as accurate. Maintaining integrity is essential for preserving the trust that users place in digital systems.	integrity	Use an analogy to explain integrity (cybersecurity).
Integrity is cybersecurity can be thought of as an unbroken chain. Just as a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, a company's security is only as good as its weakest point. If one part of the security system is compromised, the entire system may be at risk.	integrity	Use an analogy to explain integrity (cybersecurity).
Integrity is like a locked door. It can be opened with the right key, but only by those who have been granted access.	integrity	Use an analogy to explain integrity (cybersecurity).
Integrity is cyber security can be compared to a building with a solid foundation. If the foundation is strong, the building will withstand strong winds and remain standing. However, if the foundation weakens or crumbles, the entire building will collapse. The same concept applies to cybersecurity; if an organization has a strong cyber defense strategy in place, their systems and data will be protected from attacks. However, if the defenses are weak or nonexistent, the organization will be susceptible to cyber-attacks that could result in stolen data or system shutdowns.	integrity	Use an analogy to explain integrity (cybersecurity).
Intent is like a lock on a door. The key (intent) is what opens the door, and the lock (intent) is what keeps people out who don't have the key.	intent	Use an analogy to explain intent (cybersecurity).
Intent is like a door. You can either keep the door closed or you can open it. If you keep the door closed, then no one can get in. If you open the door, then people can come and go as they please. Intent is similar in that if it's not there, then no one can get into your system. But if it's there, then anyone can potentially access your system (depending on their level of authorization).	intent	Use an analogy to explain intent (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like locking your door at night. You may have a strong lock, but if you don't close and latch the door, your security is pointless. Intent matters when it comes to cybersecurity. Making sure you have locked doors, windows, and other entry points is important, but so is making sure that you protect your devices with passwords and keep your software up to date.	intent	Use an analogy to explain intent (cybersecurity).
Intent is like a door handle. You need to have the intent (or ability) to turn the doorknob in order to open the door. In cybersecurity, you need to have the intent or ability to access information in order to hack into it.	intent	Use an analogy to explain intent (cybersecurity).
If you are cooking and youintentionally set a fire in your kitchen, that is arson. You had the intent to start afire. If you were cooking and a spark from the stove flew up and caught something on fire,that would be an accidental fire. You did not have the intent to start a fire.	intent	Use an analogy to explain intent (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity interoperability can be thought of as being similar to the way that traffic flows smoothly on a highway. Just as cars and trucks need to be able to communicate with one another in order to avoid collisions, different cybersecurity systems need to be able to share information and work together in order to protect an organization's networks from attacks.	interoperability	Use an analogy to explain interoperability (cybersecurity).
Interoperability is much like a car. A car has many different parts that work together to make it run. If one part of the car doesn't work, the whole car won't run. Interoperability is the same way in cybersecurity. If one part of the system doesn't work, the whole system will be compromised.	interoperability	Use an analogy to explain interoperability (cybersecurity).
Interoperability is like a group of people trying to speak French in a room. If everyone knows the language, they can easily communicate with one another. However, if someone doesn't know how to speak French, it will be difficult for them to understand what's being said. The same concept applies to cybersecurity. If all devices are using the same security protocol, they will be able to easily communicate with each other. However, if there is a difference in security protocols, it will be more difficult for them to share information securely.	interoperability	Use an analogy to explain interoperability (cybersecurity).
If you have ever used an iPhone, you know that it is not compatible with Android devices. This means that if you have an iPhone and your friend has an Android device, you cannot share files or apps between the two devices. This is because Apple and Android are two different companies that use different operating systems. Cybersecurity interoperability refers to the ability of different cybersecurity systems to work together. For example, if a company uses one cybersecurity system, but needs to communicate with another company that uses a different system, the two systems need to be able to interoperate in order for communication to take place.	interoperability	Use an analogy to explain interoperability (cybersecurity).
Just as your car's various parts - the engine, seats, steering wheel, etc. - all need to work together in order for you to drive it, so too do the various cybersecurity components of an organization need to work together in order for the organization to be secure. If one part is out of synch or not working properly, it can throw the whole system off balance and leave it vulnerable to attack.	interoperability	Use an analogy to explain interoperability (cybersecurity).
Intrusion can be best likened to a physical break-in. Just as an intruder can gain access to a building by breaking a window or forcing open a door, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in systems and networks to gain unauthorized access to data and systems. Once inside, they may attempt to steal information or damage or disable the system.	intrusion	Use an analogy to explain intrusion (cybersecurity).
Hitting someone's car with a baseball bat is an intrusion.	intrusion	Use an analogy to explain intrusion (cybersecurity).
Intrusion can be compared to a break-in at a physical property. In the same way that an intruder can enter a building through an open window, a hacker can access your computer system by exploiting a vulnerability in your security defenses.	intrusion	Use an analogy to explain intrusion (cybersecurity).
If you imagine your computer as a walled garden, with a fence around it to keep out intruders, then a cyber intrusion would be like someone climbing over the fence and entering the garden without permission. Intrusions can come in many different forms, such as hacking into your computer to steal information or sabotaging your systems to cause damage.	intrusion	Use an analogy to explain intrusion (cybersecurity).
Intrusion can be best described as someone breaking into your house or office. In the context of cybersecurity, intrusion is an unauthorized access of data or systems, often with malicious intent.	intrusion	Use an analogy to explain intrusion (cybersecurity).
Intrusion detection can be thought of as a burglar alarm. Just as an intruder alarm warns people when someone is trying to break into a house, intrusion detection systems (IDS) are used in cybersecurity to detect and warn people of unauthorized attempts to access or damage computer networks or systems.	intrusion detection	Use an analogy to explain intrusion detection (cybersecurity).
Intrusion detection is a bit like security cameras. Security cameras can help you see what's happening in your home or office when you're not there. Intrusion detection systems do the same thing for your computer system - they watch for unusual or unauthorized activity and can notify you when something is wrong.	intrusion detection	Use an analogy to explain intrusion detection (cybersecurity).
One way to think of intrusion detection in cybersecurity is by analogy to the security cameras and motion detectors used in many businesses and homes. Security cameras allow people to visually monitor an area for suspicious activity, while motion detectors can sense when someone or something is moving in a particular area. Similarly, intrusion detection systems in cybersecurity use various methods to detect unusual or unauthorized activity on a computer network. This can include monitoring network traffic for signs of tampering or scanning for malicious software signatures.	intrusion detection	Use an analogy to explain intrusion detection (cybersecurity).
One analogy for intrusion detection in cybersecurity is that it is like a burglar alarm system for a home. The alarm system detects when someone breaks into the home, and then notifies the homeowners or authorities so that they can take action. Intrusion detection systems in cybersecurity do the same thing—they detect unauthorized access to computer systems and networks, and then notify administrators so that they can take action to stop the attack and protect their data.	intrusion detection	Use an analogy to explain intrusion detection (cybersecurity).
In intrusion detection, cybersecurity analysts are like dogs that bark when someone comes into the yard. The analysts constantly monitor the network for signs of unauthorized access or activity and sound an alarm when they find something suspicious. This helps to alert system administrators so they can take action to protect the network and its data.	intrusion detection	Use an analogy to explain intrusion detection (cybersecurity).
When investigating a crime, detectives will look for clues and evidence to try and piece together what happened. Cybersecurity professionals do the same thing when looking for vulnerabilities or threats in a network. They will examine traffic data, logs, and other information to try and find any security issues that need to be addressed.	investigate	Use an analogy to explain investigate (cybersecurity).
Investigating a cybersecurity incident is like investigating a crime. The goal is to find out what happened, who was responsible, and how they did it. Investigators will collect evidence and interview witnesses to try to piece together the story of what happened.	investigate	Use an analogy to explain investigate (cybersecurity).
When investigating a cybersecurity incident, analysts may use various forensic tools and techniques to identify the root cause of the breach and any potential vulnerabilities that were exploited. They will also work to develop mitigations to prevent future incidents from occurring.	investigate	Use an analogy to explain investigate (cybersecurity).
When you investigate something, you are looking into it to find out what happened and who is responsible. This is similar to how cybersecurity professionals will look at a breach or attack in order to determine what happened, how it was done, and who is responsible.	investigate	Use an analogy to explain investigate (cybersecurity).
Investigating cybersecurity is like investigating a crime. Officials need to gather evidence and try to figure out who was responsible. They also need to find ways to prevent future incidents from happening.	investigate	Use an analogy to explain investigate (cybersecurity).
When investigating a cybersecurity incident, imagine you are a detective on the scene of a crime. You will need to gather evidence, interview witnesses, and create a timeline of events. This process will help you determine what happened, who was responsible, and how to prevent future incidents.	investigation	Use an analogy to explain investigation (cybersecurity).
Investigation is like detective work. Investigators (in cybersecurity) use various techniques to examine data and systems for clues about potential threats and vulnerabilities. By analyzing this information, they can develop plans to protect against attacks and improve the security of their networks.	investigation	Use an analogy to explain investigation (cybersecurity).
Investigation is like a puzzle. You are given a lot of pieces, and you have to figure out how they all fit together. You may not have all the answers at first, but by investigating different sources and piecing information together, you can eventually solve the puzzle.	investigation	Use an analogy to explain investigation (cybersecurity).
When investigating a cybersecurity incident, you are like a detective who is trying to piece together what happened. You will look at the evidence that was left behind and try to figure out how the attacker was able to get into your system and what they did once they were in there.	investigation	Use an analogy to explain investigation (cybersecurity).
A good analogy for investigation in cybersecurity would be to think of it as a search for clues about an incident. Investigators will examine the evidence surrounding an attack or security breach in order to determine what happened, how it happened, and who was responsible. By understanding the nature of the attack, investigators can better protect against future incidents.	investigation	Use an analogy to explain investigation (cybersecurity).
Imagine you have a bank account that is not password protected. Anyone who knows your account number can easily access and spend your money. This is analogous to having an unsecured computer that anyone can access without a password.

The security system may not completely stop all burglaries, but it will make it more difficult for the burglars to succeed and will reduce the likelihood of your home being burglarized.	mitigation	Use an analogy to explain mitigation (cybersecurity).
Mitigation can be analogized to putting up a fence around your house. The fence serves as a physical barrier between your property and the rest of the world, preventing unauthorized people from entering.

You have to keep moving so the attacker can't hit you, and you also have to use evasive maneuvers so the attacker can't predict your movements.	moving target defense	Use an analogy to explain moving target defense (cybersecurity).
A moving target defense (cybersecurity) analogy would be to imagine trying to hit a slow-moving target while someone is constantly moving it. The defender is always changing the position of their "target," making it more difficult for the attacker to land a successful strike.	moving target defense	Use an analogy to explain moving target defense (cybersecurity).
A network is like a group of people. If one person in the group gets sick, the rest of the group can still function. However, if all of the people in the group get sick, then the group will not be able to function.	network resilience	Use an analogy to explain network resilience (cybersecurity).
A city’s electrical grid can be analogized to a computer network. The electrical grid is designed to be resilient, meaning that it has multiple backups and redundant systems in place so that if one part of the grid fails, power can still be supplied to parts of the city. A computer network can also be designed to be resilient, with multiple backups and redundant systems in place. This means that if one part of the network fails, other parts of the network can still function.	network resilience	Use an analogy to explain network resilience (cybersecurity).
A cyberattack on a network is like a hurricane damaging homes in a coastal town.

Non-repudiation is like a digital signature. It is a way to prove that the sender of a message is who they say they are, and that the message has not been tampered with in any way.	non-repudiation	Use an analogy to explain non-repudiation (cybersecurity).
If you handwrite a note to your friend and sign your name at the bottom, that note is considered to be a legally binding document. Your friend can't go back later and say, "I never received that note from you." The fact that you signed your name at the bottom assures your friend - and anyone else who may see the note - that you actually wrote it.In the same way, when you send an email or other digital communication, and you include your signature or some other form of authentication, that communication becomes much harder to dispute. It's like having a notarized letter; once it's been authenticated, there's no backing out.	non-repudiation	Use an analogy to explain non-repudiation (cybersecurity).
Non-repudiation is often likened to a signature on a document. Just as you cannot deny signing a paper, you also can't repudiate sending or receiving an email message because the recipient has evidence that the message was indeed sent from your account and not someone else's.	non-repudiation	Use an analogy to explain non-repudiation (cybersecurity).
Non-repudiation is like a locked door. It prevents either side in a communication from denying that the exchange ever took place.	non-repudiation	Use an analogy to explain non-repudiation (cybersecurity).
One way to think about non-repudiation is as a type of “digital signature.” A digital signature is like a handwritten signature, but it is created using a computer. Just like with a handwritten signature, you can use a digital signature to prove that you are the person who created a particular document or message. Non-repudiation means that the other party cannot deny that they received the message or that they were involved in the transaction.	non-repudiation	Use an analogy to explain non-repudiation (cybersecurity).

Red teaming is similar to a military concept where a group of specialists (red team) are assigned to attack an organization or system from the outside in order to identify any weaknesses that can be exploited by adversaries. The intent is not only to find and fix vulnerabilities but also help organizations improve their defensive posture and resilience against attacks.	red team	Use an analogy to explain red team (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity red teams can be thought of as analogous to the military’s concept of a “red team.” Just as a red team in the military is tasked with coming up with innovative and unexpected ways to attack an opponent, so too do cybersecurity red teams adopt the same mission in relation to information technology (IT) systems. By identifying potential vulnerabilities and points of entry, red teams help organizations identify and patch any holes that may exist in their IT security posture.	red team	Use an analogy to explain red team (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a battlefield. There are two teams, the good guys (the red team) and the bad guys (the blue team). The red team tries to find holes in the security of the system while the blue team defends against them.	red team	Use an analogy to explain red team (cybersecurity).
Red teaming is akin to playing the role of an adversary in a cybersecurity exercise or drill. The red team operates as if it is a malicious actor, seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in order to gain unauthorized access to systems or data. Red teams can be used during all phases of the system development life cycle, from design and testing through implementation and operations.	red team	Use an analogy to explain red team (cybersecurity).
A red team exercise is like a game of chess. The white team (blue team) represents the defender, while the black team (red team) represents the attacker. The goal of the game is to see how well the defender can protect its pieces against being captured by the attacker.	red team exercise	Use an analogy to explain red team exercise (cybersecurity).
A red team exercise is similar to a military drill. A red team is a group of experts who are tasked with attacking an organization or system in order to find its weaknesses. This allows the organization or system's defenders to identify and fix any vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by actual attackers.	red team exercise	Use an analogy to explain red team exercise (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity red team exercises are similar to military operations. Just as a general on the battlefield orders units around and plans strategy, analysts in cybersecurity use red team exercises to test their ability to withstand attacks and respond. Red teams in cybersecurity act as the aggressors, launching simulated cyberattacks against networks, systems and applications. Defenders must then identify the attack, determine its origin and stop it. The goal is to improve defenses by learning from real-world situations without actually putting your organization at risk.	red team exercise	Use an analogy to explain red team exercise (cybersecurity).
Red team exercises can be thought of as akin to a military drill. In a red team exercise, cyber attackers are tasked with infiltrating and compromising a target organization in order to test the security controls and response capabilities of the victim organization. The goal is to identify weaknesses that could be exploited by real-world attackers.	red team exercise	Use an analogy to explain red team exercise (cybersecurity).
A red team exercise can be thought of as a penetration test or “pentest.” The objective of a pentest is to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in order to assess the security posture of the target system. A red team exercise is typically conducted by an organization’s internal cybersecurity team, while a pentest is generally performed by an external security consultant.	red team exercise	Use an analogy to explain red team exercise (cybersecurity).
Redundancy is like having two of the same thing. For example, if you have two tires on your car, it means that if one tire pops, you can still drive on the other one. In cybersecurity, redundancy means having multiple ways to protect your data. This could mean having multiple passwords, using different types of security software, and backing up your data regularly.	redundancy	Use an analogy to explain redundancy (cybersecurity).
Redundancy is like having multiple fire extinguishers in your home. If one is used, there is another one available to put out the fire. In cybersecurity, redundancy means having multiple layers of security protection in place so that if one layer fails, another will still be operational.	redundancy	Use an analogy to explain redundancy (cybersecurity).
Redundancy (cybersecurity) is like having a backup of your computer files in case something happens to the originals. You might have two copies of every important file on separate hard drives, or you might save different versions of your files to different places. That way, if something happens to one copy – for example, if your computer crashes or gets hacked – you still have the other copy to fall back on.	redundancy	Use an analogy to explain redundancy (cybersecurity).
You can think of cybersecurity as being like a car's airbag. Airbags are not 100% effective, but they provide an extra layer of protection in the event of a crash. Cybersecurity is similar: it is not foolproof, but it can help to reduce the risk of a cyberattack.	redundancy	Use an analogy to explain redundancy (cybersecurity).
Redundancy is like having a backup plan. If something goes wrong with one part of your system, you have another part that can take over. This is important in cybersecurity because there are many ways for hackers to break into a system. You need to have multiple layers of protection so that if one layer fails, the other layers will still keep your data safe.	redundancy	Use an analogy to explain redundancy (cybersecurity).
A cybersecurity analogy for resilience would be to imagine your computer as a fortress. Attacks can come in through the front gates, but if the walls are high and strong, and the defenders are vigilant, most of those attacks will be repelled. However, if a hole is found in the wall, or the defenders are lazy or distracted, the attackers will get in and do damage. The best way to prevent this is by repairing any holes that are found quickly and keeping the defenders on their toes.	resilience	Use an analogy to explain resilience (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity resilience is like a rubber band. It can be stretched and pulled, but it will eventually snap back to its original form. Similarly, cybersecurity resilience can be tested by attackers, but it will always rebound and protect the network.	resilience	Use an analogy to explain resilience (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity resilience is like a rubber band. It can stretch and bend but it will always snap back to its original shape. Cybersecurity resilience means that your organization can bounce back from a cyberattack and continue to operate as usual.	resilience	Use an analogy to explain resilience (cybersecurity).
A computer that is resilient to cyber-attacks has multiple layers of security protection. If an attacker manages to penetrate one layer of security, they are met with another barrier, which makes it more difficult for them to access sensitive data or systems. Like a fortress with multiple walls, a resilient computer system is much harder to breach than one that has a single layer of defense.	resilience	Use an analogy to explain resilience (cybersecurity).
 resilience (cybersecurity) can be analogized to a bouncer in a nightclub. They are both responsible for maintaining the security of their respective domain, and they must also remain vigilant against potential threats. The bouncer is constantly monitoring the crowd for signs of trouble, while the resilient cybersecurity systems are always on the lookout for malicious actors and malware. If either one fails to do their job, it could lead to disaster.	resilience	Use an analogy to explain resilience (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity can be thought of as a defense strategy employed by an individual or organization to protect its computer networks and user data from unauthorized access or theft. just as you would fortify your home with locks on the doors and windows, cybersecurity defenses work to keep criminals out of your computer systems. firewalls, anti-virus software, and password protection are all common methods used to deter cyberattacks.	response	Use an analogy to explain response (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a locked door. The lock (cybersecurity) prevents anyone from entering without the key (password).	response	Use an analogy to explain response (cybersecurity).
A cybersecurity response plan could be thought of as a fire escape plan. Just like you have a specific set of steps to follow in case of a fire, you need a specific set of steps to follow in case your organization experiences a cyberattack. Your cybersecurity response plan should include things like who will be responsible for each step, what communication channels will be used, and which systems will be impacted. Having a detailed response plan in place can help minimize the damage caused by a cyberattack and ensure that your organization is able to quickly recover.	response	Use an analogy to explain response (cybersecurity).
A response to a cyberattack is like fighting an incoming fire. In both cases, you have to act quickly and decisively to minimize the damage. You also need to have a plan in place so that you can respond effectively when an attack occurs.	response	Use an analogy to explain response (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a locked door. The lock is the security measure that prevents unauthorized access to the door. The key is the authentication method that confirms the identity of the person attempting to open the door. If both the lock and key are in good condition, then it's safe to assume that only authorized individuals can gain access to whatever is behind the door.	response	Use an analogy to explain response (cybersecurity).
As a business, you may have a disaster response plan for fires, floods, and other physical emergencies. Your cyber security response plan is analogous to that. It is a set of steps and procedures you follow in the event of a cyber incident or attack. Just as with your disaster response plan, your goal is to protect your people and property, contain the damage, and get back to normal operations as quickly as possible.	response plan	Use an analogy to explain response plan (cybersecurity).
A response plan for cybersecurity is similar to a fire drill. Just as you would have a plan in place for what to do if a fire started in your building, you need a plan in place for what to do if your computer or network was hacked. You need to know who to contact, what steps to take, and how to respond quickly so that the damage is minimized.	response plan	Use an analogy to explain response plan (cybersecurity).
A response plan for cybersecurity is similar to a fire drill. Just as you would have a plan in place for what to do if there was a fire in your building, you also need a plan in place for what to do if your computer system was hacked. Your response plan should include steps for how to investigate the incident, how to contain the damage, and how to prevent future attacks.	response plan	Use an analogy to explain response plan (cybersecurity).
A response plan for cybersecurity is like a fire drill. If there is a fire, everyone knows what to do and where to go. In the event of a cyberattack, everyone will know how to respond and who to contact.	response plan	Use an analogy to explain response plan (cybersecurity).
A response plan for cybersecurity is somewhat like a fire drill. In both cases, people are expected to know what to do in case of an emergency. With a cybersecurity response plan, employees are trained to recognize suspicious emails or activity and know how to respond. Just as with a fire drill, it's important that everyone participate so that everyone knows what to do if there is a real emergency.	response plan	Use an analogy to explain response plan (cybersecurity).
The risk of an attacker breaking into a computer system is like the risk that someone will break into your home. There is always some chance that it could happen, and you can take steps to reduce the chances, but you can never completely eliminate the risk.	risk	Use an analogy to explain risk (cybersecurity).
A risk is like a hurricane. It might not happen, but if it does, the results can be catastrophic.	risk	Use an analogy to explain risk (cybersecurity).
Risk can be thought of as a cyber security analogy using a bank. The bank has a vault filled with money. The amount of money in the vault is the risk. The more money in the vault, the higher the risk that it could be stolen. Similarly, the more data an organization stores online, the higher the risk that it could be hacked and stolen.	risk	Use an analogy to explain risk (cybersecurity).
Risk (cybersecurity) is like driving a car. Driving a car carries the risk of being in an accident, but we still drive because the benefits (getting from point A to point B) outweigh the risks. Similarly, using the internet and other digital technologies comes with inherent cybersecurity risks, but the benefits (connecting with loved ones, doing our jobs, accessing information) outweigh the risks for most people. Just as we take precautions when driving (buckling up, staying alert), we should also take precautions when using digital technology (using strong passwords, installing antivirus software).	risk	Use an analogy to explain risk (cybersecurity).
Risk (cybersecurity) is like a car. It can be incredibly useful and make our lives easier, but it also has the potential to cause great harm if used carelessly or improperly. In order to reap the benefits of a car while minimizing its risks, we need to take precautions and use it responsibly. Likewise, in order to safely enjoy the many advantages of the internet while minimizing our exposure to cyber threats, we need to employ sensible security practices.	risk	Use an analogy to explain risk (cybersecurity).
Risk analysis is like a fire drill. You have a plan in place in case of an emergency, and you practice it so that everyone knows what to do if a fire starts. In the same way, you need to have a plan for how to protect your computer from cyberattacks, and you need to practice that plan so that everyone knows what to do if an attack happens.	risk analysis	Use an analogy to explain risk analysis (cybersecurity).
Risk analysis can be thought of as a cyber-security version of the game “scissors, paper, rock.” In this analogy, scissors beats paper (i.e., a successful attack that exploits a vulnerability in software), while rock beats scissors (i.e., using strong authentication measures to protect against attack). Paper therefore represents a low risk and rock represents a high risk.	risk analysis	Use an analogy to explain risk analysis (cybersecurity).
Risk analysis is like checking the brakes on a car. It's a process of inspecting and evaluating potential risks so that you can take measures to protect yourself from them. In the context of cybersecurity, risk analysis helps you identify vulnerabilities in your systems and decide what steps to take to mitigate those risks.	risk analysis	Use an analogy to explain risk analysis (cybersecurity).
Risk analysis can be likened to a doctor's examination. The doctor examines the patient for any signs of illness and determines what, if any, treatments are necessary. Cybersecurity risk analysts examine networks and systems for signs of weakness and determine what countermeasures should be implemented to protect them from attack.	risk analysis	Use an analogy to explain risk analysis (cybersecurity).
One way to think of risk analysis is as a form of insurance. You are buying a policy that will pay out in the event something bad happens. The cost of the policy is based on how likely it is that something bad will happen and how much damage it would cause if it did. Risk analysis for cybersecurity is similar. You are trying to figure out how likely it is that your network will be hacked and what the potential damage would be if it were. You then use this information to decide what level of protection you need and how much money you should spend on security measures.	risk analysis	Use an analogy to explain risk analysis (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like having a fortress with walls, gates, and guards. The walls are meant to keep out intruders, the gates are meant to control who comes in and out of the fortress, and the guards are there to protect the inhabitants of the fortress from harm. However, even if all of these defenses are in place, there is still a chance that an intruder can get past them and cause harm. This is why risk assessment is so important; it helps you identify which areas of your cybersecurity defenses are most vulnerable so that you can take steps to shore up those weaknesses.	risk assessment	Use an analogy to explain risk assessment (cybersecurity).
Risk assessment is similar to a fire drill. Just as you would plan and practice a fire drill in case of an emergency, you should also assess your organization's risk for potential cyberattacks and have a plan in place to protect your data.	risk assessment	Use an analogy to explain risk assessment (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity risk assessment is similar to a doctor's risk assessment when diagnosing a patient. The doctor considers many factors including the patient's symptoms, family history, and other medical conditions to arrive at a diagnosis. In the same way, cybersecurity professionals consider many factors such as the organization's online assets, threat actors' tactics and methods, and existing security controls to identify potential risks.	risk assessment	Use an analogy to explain risk assessment (cybersecurity).
When you are driving, you assess the risk of each potential action before taking it. This might involve looking at the road conditions, your speed, the traffic around you, and other factors. Cybersecurity is similar in that you need to assess the risk of each potential action before taking it. This might involve looking at the vulnerability of your system, the likelihood of an attack happening, and other factors.	risk assessment	Use an analogy to explain risk assessment (cybersecurity).
Risk assessment is like a doctor's check-up. The doctor looks at your medical history and performs tests to see if you have any health risks. They then create a plan to address any potential problems.	risk assessment	Use an analogy to explain risk assessment (cybersecurity).
Risk management is like driving a car. You need to be aware of the risks (e.g., other drivers, pedestrians, weather conditions), and you need to take actions to mitigate those risks (using your turn signal, wearing a seatbelt).	risk management	Use an analogy to explain risk management (cybersecurity).
Risk management can be thought of as a car. The driver is the risk manager and the car is the computer system. The goal of risk management is to get from point A to point B safely. To do this, the driver needs to pay attention to all of the risks that are present while driving, including other cars on the road, pedestrians, weather conditions, and so on. In order for the driver to make sure that they reach their destination safely, they need to take action to mitigate any potential risks along the way.This same concept applies when it comes to cybersecurity. Organizations need to be aware of all of the risks that are posed to their computer systems and then take steps to mitigate those risks. This could include using firewalls, antivirus software, password policies, and other security measures. By taking these precautions, organizations can help protect themselves against cyber threats and reduce their chances of experiencing a data breach or other type of attack.	risk management	Use an analogy to explain risk management (cybersecurity).
Risk management is similar to a carpenter using a saw. A carpenter must use a saw to cut wood, but if the saw isn't handled properly, it can cause harm. The same is true for risk management in cybersecurity. Organizations must use risk management principles to protect their networks and data, but if these principles aren't applied correctly, they can lead to security breaches and data loss.	risk management	Use an analogy to explain risk management (cybersecurity).
Risk management is like putting on a seat belt when you get in your car. You are doing everything possible to protect yourself from injury in case of an accident. Risk management (cybersecurity) is the same way – you are using all available resources to protect yourself from potential cyberattacks.	risk management	Use an analogy to explain risk management (cybersecurity).
Risk management can be thought of as a way to protect your computer from viruses. You use antivirus software to scan your computer for any malicious files that may have been installed, and you also install updates to the software regularly so that you are protected against the latest threats. In the same way, risk management is a way to protect your business from cyberattacks. You can use tools like firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help identify any attacks early, and you also need to keep your software up-to-date so that you are protected against the latest threats.	risk management	Use an analogy to explain risk management (cybersecurity).
A company is like a ship sailing in the ocean. The captain and crew are constantly aware of their surroundings, looking out for any potential risks that could jeopardize the safety of the ship and its passengers. In order to mitigate those risks, they take measures such as having lifeboats ready in case of an emergency, keeping a lookout for other vessels in the area, and making sure the ship is properly equipped with supplies and tools to deal with any situation that may arise.Similarly, when it comes to cybersecurity, companies need to be proactive in identifying potential risks and taking steps to mitigate them. This includes implementing security measures such as firewalls, antivirus software, and password protection; training employees on how to spot phishing attacks and other scams; and establishing best practices for handling sensitive data. By being vigilant and proactive about risk mitigation, businesses can help protect themselves against cyberattacks and keep their networks safe from harm.	risk mitigation	Use an analogy to explain risk mitigation (cybersecurity).
One analogy for risk mitigation (cybersecurity) is that it is like insurance. Just as you hope you will never need to use your insurance policy, you also hope that you will never have a cybersecurity incident. However, if something does happen, having good risk management practices in place can help minimize the impact of the event.	risk mitigation	Use an analogy to explain risk mitigation (cybersecurity).
Risk mitigation is like putting on a seatbelt while driving. You are still taking a risk by driving, but the seatbelt reduces that risk. Similarly, cybersecurity measures reduce the risk of cyberattacks.	risk mitigation	Use an analogy to explain risk mitigation (cybersecurity).
A company may have a cybersecurity plan in place that includes regular backups of their data, user training on identifying phishing attempts, and malware/virus protection. This would be an example of risk mitigation as they are taking steps to protect themselves from potential cyber threats.	risk mitigation	Use an analogy to explain risk mitigation (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity professionals are like firefighters. They work to prevent fires (cyberattacks) from happening, but they also have plans in place for when a fire does start. They use fire extinguishers and hoses to put out the flames, and they may also evacuate the building if necessary.	risk mitigation	Use an analogy to explain risk mitigation (cybersecurity).
A company that manufactures cars is always balancing the risk of a potential car accident against the cost of installing expensive safety features. The same is true for data security. Organizations must weigh the risk of a cyberattack against the costs of implementing stronger security measures. For example, adding a password requirement to an online form may be seen as low-risk and low-cost, while deploying advanced encryption technologies would be seen as high-risk and high-cost.	risk-based data management	Use an analogy to explain risk-based data management (cybersecurity).
Risk-based data management is like locking your car when you leave it parked on the street. You may not need to do it every time, but you do it more often when it's dark outside and there are fewer people around. The same goes for cybersecurity: you don't need to take all the same security measures at all times, but you should increase your precautions when certain conditions exist (like dealing with high-value data or communicating with sensitive information).	risk-based data management	Use an analogy to explain risk-based data management (cybersecurity).
Risk-based data management can be compared to the way a bank manages its money. The bank weighs the risks associated with each investment and makes decisions accordingly. For example, it might invest in low-risk bonds that offer modest returns, or it might put more money into high-risk ventures that could yield big payouts but also carry greater risk of loss.In the same way, a company's cybersecurity strategy should take into account the various risks posed by different types of data. Sensitive information such as credit card numbers should be given extra protection, for example, while less sensitive data may not need the same level of security. By assessing and mitigating risk on a case-by-case basis, companies can better protect their valuable data assets."	risk-based data management	Use an analogy to explain risk-based data management (cybersecurity).
Risk-based data management is like locking your car doors when you park it in a bad neighborhood. You're not going to lock your car doors when you park it in your driveway, because the risk of someone breaking into your car is low. But, you're going to lock your car doors when you park it in a bad neighborhood, because the risk of someone breaking into your car is high.	risk-based data management	Use an analogy to explain risk-based data management (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is a bit like locking your house. You can do it with a basic lock or a more sophisticated one, but either way, you’re taking some risk that someone will be able to break in. The better the lock, the lower the risk, and vice versa. Risk-based data management is similar: It involves using different levels of security based on how much risk you’re willing to take. For example, you might use a strong password for your bank account but only require a basic password for email.	risk-based data management	Use an analogy to explain risk-based data management (cybersecurity).
A rootkit is a bit like cancer. It starts off small, and seemingly insignificant, but if left untreated it will grow and spread until it takes over the entire system. Similarly, a rootkit can be very difficult to detect and remove, and can cause serious damage if not dealt with quickly.	rootkit	Use an analogy to explain rootkit (cybersecurity).
A rootkit can be thought of as akin to a cancerous growth in the body. Just as the cancer is undetectable by sight and only becomes evident after it has had time to grow and spread, so too is a rootkit hidden from view on a computer system until it has already done damage. Like cancer, once a rootkit takes hold it is very difficult to remove completely, and can come back even after seemingly successful treatment.	rootkit	Use an analogy to explain rootkit (cybersecurity).
A rootkit is like a cancerous tumor. It is hidden from view and can do a lot of damage before it is discovered and removed.	rootkit	Use an analogy to explain rootkit (cybersecurity).
A rootkit is a cybersecurity tool that allows an attacker to gain administrator access to a computer or network server. It is a software program that hides its presence on the system, making it difficult for administrators and anti-virus programs to detect.	rootkit	Use an analogy to explain rootkit (cybersecurity).
A rootkit is like a virus that lives in the "root" of your computer's operating system. It can take control of your computer, steal your information, and even prevent you from detecting it. Just like a virus, you need to be very careful when downloading software or opening emails from unknown sources, because you could get a rootkit without knowing it.	rootkit	Use an analogy to explain rootkit (cybersecurity).
A secret key is like a password. It is a piece of information that is used to encrypt or decrypt data.	secret key	Use an analogy to explain secret key (cybersecurity).
Secret key cryptography is like a safe. The combination to the safe is the secret key. To unlock the safe, you need to know the combination. Only someone who knows the combination can open the safe.	secret key	Use an analogy to explain secret key (cybersecurity).
Secret key cryptography is similar to locking your door with a key. You keep the key (secret) hidden from everyone else and use it to lock/unlock the door. Only those who have the key can access the contents of the locked room.	secret key	Use an analogy to explain secret key (cybersecurity).
Secret key cryptography is like a locked mailbox with a combination lock. The sender uses the combination to lock the mailbox and sends the message inside. The recipient uses the same combination to unlock the mailbox and retrieve the message.	secret key	Use an analogy to explain secret key (cybersecurity).
Secret key is like a lock and key. The lock is the data that needs to be secured, and the key is the secret information used to unlock the data.	secret key	Use an analogy to explain secret key (cybersecurity).
When you secure your home, you might lock the doors and windows, install an alarm system, and keep a watchful eye on things. In the same way, when you secure your computer systems and networks, you might use firewalls, encryption, and other security measures to protect them from unauthorized access.	securely provision	Use an analogy to explain securely provision (cybersecurity).
Just as you would not leave your door unlocked when you leave your house, you should take similar precautions to protect your digital devices and information. This includes using strong passwords, installing security software, and being mindful of who you share information with.	securely provision	Use an analogy to explain securely provision (cybersecurity).
Wearing a seat belt while driving in a car is an analogy for securely provisioning (cybersecurity). Just as you would buckle your seat belt to protect yourself from injuries in the event of a car accident, you need to take similar precautions to secure your devices and data from cyber threats.	securely provision	Use an analogy to explain securely provision (cybersecurity).
A safe is an analogy for how to provision cybersecurity. Just as you would use a key to open a safe and access its contents, you need authentication credentials (e.g., username and password) in order to log into a system and access its data. You can also think of encryption as the locking mechanism on the door of the safe - without it, anyone who gains unauthorized access to the safe can see everything inside. By using strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and encrypting your data, you can help keep your information secure while it's in transit or at rest.	securely provision	Use an analogy to explain securely provision (cybersecurity).
Securely provisioning (cybersecurity) is a bit like putting locks on your doors and windows. It's a way to make it more difficult for someone to break into your house, steal your stuff, and hurt you. Securely provisioning (cybersecurity) is also like installing an alarm system in your house. This will help warn you if someone is trying to break in so that you can take action to stop them.	securely provision	Use an analogy to explain securely provision (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity can be compared to the security measures that are in place at an airport. Just as there are many different aspects of airport security that must be automated in order to be effective (e.g. baggage screening, passenger screening, etc.), there are also many different aspects of cybersecurity that must be automated in order to be effective (e.g. malware detection, vulnerability scanning, etc.).	security automation	Use an analogy to explain security automation (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a locked door. Security automation is the key that unlocks the door. Security automation automates the process of locking and unlocking the door, making it faster and easier for you to secure your property.	security automation	Use an analogy to explain security automation (cybersecurity).
Security automation is like having a security guard at your door. The security guard is always there to monitor who comes in and out of your house. If someone tries to enter without permission, the security guard will stop them. Security automation does the same thing for your computer. It monitors all of the activity on your computer and prevents unauthorized access.	security automation	Use an analogy to explain security automation (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is a lot like locks on doors. Security automation is the process of using technology to help manage and monitor security-related tasks such as locking doors, turning off devices when they’re not in use, and providing alerts when something out of the ordinary happens.	security automation	Use an analogy to explain security automation (cybersecurity).
One analogy for security automation is a home security system. A homeowner can protect their home by setting up sensors on windows and doors, and then connecting these sensors to a control panel that will notify them when someone enters the property. Security automation in cybersecurity works in a similar way, by using software to detect threats and automatically responding to them.	security automation	Use an analogy to explain security automation (cybersecurity).
A security incident can be thought of as a cyber breach, or even an attack. It's essentially when unauthorized access is gained to a network or system, usually through malware or some other form of hacking. This can lead to data theft, destruction, and all sorts of havoc for the organization that's been targeted.	security incident	Use an analogy to explain security incident (cybersecurity).
If you think of your computer as a building, malware would be the equivalent of someone breaking into that building through a window. A security incident is when someone successfully breaks into your computer and steals or damages data.	security incident	Use an analogy to explain security incident (cybersecurity).
When you leave your house, you lock the door to ensure that no one can enter without your permission. This is analogous to cybersecurity measures like firewalls and password protection. By locking the door, you are preventing unauthorized people from entering your house and potentially doing harm. In the same way, by using cybersecurity measures, you are preventing unauthorized individuals from accessing your computer or network and doing harm.	security incident	Use an analogy to explain security incident (cybersecurity).
One way to think about cybersecurity is as though it were a raging house fire. Just like in any other emergency, firefighters are called in to put out the blaze and protect the occupants and their belongings. In the case of a cyberattack, computer security experts work to extinguish the flames (i.e., the hackers' efforts) and shore up vulnerabilities so that future attacks are less likely to succeed.	security incident	Use an analogy to explain security incident (cybersecurity).
A security incident is similar to a burglary. Just as burglars break into your home in search of valuable possessions, cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in your systems to steal or damage your data. Security incidents can have a serious impact on your business, costing you time and money while you work to recover from the attack.	security incident	Use an analogy to explain security incident (cybersecurity).
A security policy can be thought of as a fence around a house. The purpose of the fence is to keep people out, and it does this by making it difficult or impossible for them to get in. Security policies work in much the same way on computers, by blocking access to unauthorized users and preventing them from gaining control of the system.	security policy	Use an analogy to explain security policy (cybersecurity).
A firewall is like a bouncer at a nightclub. It checks the identification of everyone who tries to enter and only allows those who are authorized to go in. Similarly, a security policy is like a set of rules that determines which users are allowed access to the network and what they can do once they're inside.	security policy	Use an analogy to explain security policy (cybersecurity).
A security policy can be thought of as a fence around a house. The fence is not there to keep people out, but rather it is there to keep people in. Likewise, a security policy is put into place to protect the assets of an organization and its users.	security policy	Use an analogy to explain security policy (cybersecurity).
A security policy can be thought of as a set of rules that dictate how an organization will protect its computer systems and data from unauthorized access or use. Just as there are traffic laws that dictate how drivers should behave when on the road, a security policy establishes guidelines for employee behavior when using company computers. It also specifies which security measures need to be in place in order to keep the network safe from attack.	security policy	Use an analogy to explain security policy (cybersecurity).
A security policy can be compared to the speed limit on a highway. Just as drivers are required to adhere to the speed limit in order to ensure the safety of everyone travelling on the road, organizations are required to adhere to certain security policies in order to protect their networks and data from unauthorized access or theft. By establishing and enforcing security policies, organizations can help safeguard their information systems from potential threats while still allowing employees enough flexibility and freedom to conduct business as usual.	security policy	Use an analogy to explain security policy (cybersecurity).
A security program is like a pyramid. The base of the pyramid is made up of the fundamental security measures that are necessary to protect an organization's systems and data. These measures might include things like installing firewalls, using anti-virus software, and encrypting data. As you move up the pyramid, additional layers of protection are added. These might include things like intrusion detection systems, privileged access management, and incident response plans. The goal is to build a comprehensive security program that can protect an organization from all types of attacks.	security program management	Use an analogy to explain security program management (cybersecurity).
Program management is like building a house. Security program management (cybersecurity) is the process of ensuring that all the components of the house (the security controls) are properly designed, tested, and implemented to protect the structure from weather damage, burglary, and other threats. Just as with any construction project, there will be times when changes need to be made due to budgetary constraints or design flaws. The program manager must ensure that these changes are made in a way that does not compromise the security of the home.	security program management	Use an analogy to explain security program management (cybersecurity).
The task of managing a security program can be thought of as being like the task of managing a household. Just as it is necessary to have an overall plan for how the household will be run, it is also necessary to have an overall plan for how the organization's security will be managed. This plan must take into account such things as who will be responsible for various aspects of security, what tools and technologies will be used, and how security measures will be enforced.	security program management	Use an analogy to explain security program management (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a bouncer at the door of a club, checking IDs to make sure that only authorized people are allowed in. Security program management is responsible for making sure that the bouncer is doing his job correctly and that no unauthorized people are getting past him.	security program management	Use an analogy to explain security program management (cybersecurity).
Security program management is like a car alarm. A car alarm is not 100% effective at preventing theft, but it greatly reduces the chances of your car being stolen. Likewise, security program management is not 100% effective at preventing cyber attacks, but it greatly reduces the chances of your company being hacked.	security program management	Use an analogy to explain security program management (cybersecurity).
Signature is like a fingerprint. Just as each person has a unique fingerprint, each computer system or user has their own unique signature. Signature technology uses this information to identify and authenticate systems and users.	signature	Use an analogy to explain signature (cybersecurity).

When you sign your name on a document, you are verifying that the document is yours and that you approve of its contents. A digital signature works in much the same way: it verifies the identity of the sender and confirms that the message has not been tampered with.	signature	Use an analogy to explain signature (cybersecurity).
One way to think of a digital signature is as a kind of cyber-stamp. Just as an individual might use a physical stamp to sign their name on a document, in the same way they can use a digital stamp (or signature) to verify their identity online.	signature	Use an analogy to explain signature (cybersecurity).
Situational awareness is like being in a dark room and knowing where the exit is. You may not see what's going on around you, but you are aware of your surroundings and can take action if needed. In cybersecurity, situational awareness means being aware of potential cyber threats and taking steps to protect yourself from them.	situational awareness	Use an analogy to explain situational awareness (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like being in a dark room and hearing someone coming up the stairs. You may not see them, but you hear them and know they are there. You can then take steps to protect yourself, such as hiding or defending yourself.	situational awareness	Use an analogy to explain situational awareness (cybersecurity).
Just as a driver needs to be aware of their surroundings while driving, so too does a computer user need to be aware of what is happening on their computer and in the digital world around them.

Situational awareness can be best understood as akin to being in a dark room and having someone whisper that there is an intruder in the room. With situational awareness, you are constantly aware of your surroundings and what potential threats may exist – even if you can't see them. In cybersecurity, this means being aware of all the ways an attacker could potentially exploit your systems and taking steps to mitigate those risks.	situational awareness	Use an analogy to explain situational awareness (cybersecurity).
Situational awareness is like being aware of your surroundings when you are walking in a city. You know where the busy streets are, where to find a taxi, and which areas to avoid. In the same way, situational awareness in cybersecurity means being aware of potential threats and knowing how to protect your organization from them.	situational awareness	Use an analogy to explain situational awareness (cybersecurity).
Software assurance can be seen as a form of insurance for your computer. Just like with car or home insurance, you pay a monthly or yearly premium in order to have coverage in case something goes wrong. In the case of software assurance, this means having protection against cyberattacks and other security threats.	software assurance	Use an analogy to explain software assurance (cybersecurity).
Software assurance is like a lock on your door. It's there to help protect your home from burglars. If someone tries to break into your house, the lock will keep them out.

A building's foundation is critical to its stability and security. The same is true for software assurance and cybersecurity. Security engineering builds a strong foundation for an application or system by incorporating security into the design and development process. This makes it more resistant to attack and helps protect against data breaches, malware, and other threats. Software assurance provides further protection by verifying that the software meets industry standards for security and functionality. Together, these two disciplines create a robust cyber defense that can withstand even the most determined hacker	software assurance and security engineering	Use an analogy to explain software assurance and security engineering (cybersecurity).
Just as an architect designs a building to be structurally sound and able to withstand the test of time, a software assurance engineer or cybersecurity engineer designs software with security in mind. They work to identify potential vulnerabilities and design countermeasures to protect against them. Like architects, they must constantly take into account new threats and updated methods for circumventing security measures.	software assurance and security engineering	Use an analogy to explain software assurance and security engineering (cybersecurity).
Software assurance and security engineering can be thought of as locks on a door. The locks are there to provide security for the people inside the room. In order to have effective security, both the locks and the door need to be in good condition. Security also depends on how well people use the locks - if they don't close and lock the door when they leave, then all the locks in the world won't help.	software assurance and security engineering	Use an analogy to explain software assurance and security engineering (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like electrical engineering. It is the study of how to protect electronic equipment from damage or unauthorized use. Cybersecurity is also like civil engineering. It is the study of how to protect computer networks and digital information from harm.	software assurance and security engineering	Use an analogy to explain software assurance and security engineering (cybersecurity).
Software assurance can be thought of as a car's airbag. It is not intended to prevent accidents, but it increases the chance that the driver and passengers will survive if an accident does occur.

Just like with other types of infections, spam can cause harm to your computer or device, and it can also slow down your system.	spam	Use an analogy to explain spam (cybersecurity).
Just as water spills out of a container when it's overfilled, cybercriminals can exploit security vulnerabilities to steal data or disable systems. Organizations must take steps to secure their networks and protect against unauthorized access.	spillage	Use an analogy to explain spillage (cybersecurity).
Spillage is like a water spill in your kitchen. You have to clean it up as quickly as possible to avoid damage and make sure the liquid doesn't spread. In the same way, you want to address cybersecurity spills immediately to prevent further damage and protect your data.	spillage	Use an analogy to explain spillage (cybersecurity).
Spillage can be compared to a leaky faucet. Just as water leaks out of a faucet over time, data can "leak" out of an organization's computer systems and networks over time, potentially compromising the security and privacy of that information.	spillage	Use an analogy to explain spillage (cybersecurity).
One way to think of cybersecurity spillage is as if it were a hazardous material. In the same way that companies have to take special precautions in order to ensure that there is no accidental release of a dangerous chemical, organizations need to be similarly mindful when it comes to data security. Cybersecurity spillage can refer not just to large-scale breaches, but also any incident in which confidential information is unintentionally released. This could include anything from sending an unencrypted email containing sensitive customer data, to leaving a document containing passwords unattended in a public place.	spillage	Use an analogy to explain spillage (cybersecurity).
Spillage is like a spill in your kitchen. You are cooking and something boils over, making a mess on the stovetop, floor, and cabinets. The same thing can happen with cybersecurity. You may have a firewall in place to protect your computer network from unauthorized access, but if someone finds a way to get around it, they can cause major damage by spilling confidential information or taking down the system altogether.	spillage	Use an analogy to explain spillage (cybersecurity).
Spoofing is basically when somebody sends a fake email or text message that looks like it's from a legitimate sender. So, for example, you might get an email from your bank that says there's been an unauthorized charge on your account and asks you to click on a link to verify your information. But if the email is actually spam, it may have come from someone other than your bank and clicking on the link could potentially give them access to your personal information.	spoofing	Use an analogy to explain spoofing (cybersecurity).
Spoofing can be thought of as like a bad actor wearing a disguise to fool people into thinking they are someone else.

Spyware can be very difficult to get rid of, and often leaves behind traces that can compromise your privacy or security.	spyware	Use an analogy to explain spyware (cybersecurity).
Strategic planning and policy development in the cybersecurity context can be thought of as analogous to building a house. The first step is to develop a plan for the house, laying out what it will look like, what materials will be used, and how it will be constructed. This plan serves as a roadmap for completing the project. Once the plan is in place, next steps involve acquiring the necessary materials and beginning construction. Throughout this process, modifications may need to be made based on unforeseen developments; for example, if weather conditions cause delays, or new information about how best to build the house comes to light. In much the same way, strategic planning and policy development in cybersecurity are ongoing processes that must adapt as new challenges and opportunities arise.	strategic planning and policy development	Use an analogy to explain strategic planning and policy development (cybersecurity).
Policy development and strategic planning can be compared to a journey. The overall goal is to reach the destination, which in this case is an improved cybersecurity posture. Along the way there will be challenges, but with careful planning and execution those challenges can be overcome. The first step is to identify the starting point, which in this case would be the organization’s current state of cybersecurity. Next, an assessment must be conducted to understand what improvements need to be made. Once that information has been gathered, a plan can be put into place detailing how these improvements will be made. Finally, it is important to track progress and make course corrections as needed in order to stay on track and achieve the desired outcome.	strategic planning and policy development	Use an analogy to explain strategic planning and policy development (cybersecurity).
Strategic planning and policy development (cybersecurity) is a lot like playing chess. You need to think ahead about the possible moves your opponent could make, and plan accordingly. In order to win, you also need to have a good strategy for defending against your opponent's moves.	strategic planning and policy development	Use an analogy to explain strategic planning and policy development (cybersecurity).
Strategic planning is like creating a map of where you want to go. It lays out your organization's goals and how you will achieve them. Policy development is like deciding what route to take to get there. It determines the specific steps that need to be taken in order to reach your goals. Cybersecurity is like making sure that everyone in your group knows their role, has the right tools for the job, and stays on track while en route.	strategic planning and policy development	Use an analogy to explain strategic planning and policy development (cybersecurity).
Just as a city planner must take numerous factors into account when designing a new neighborhood—such as the need for schools, hospitals, and parks; how to handle traffic congestion; and zoning regulations—a cybersecurity strategist must consider many issues when developing a cybersecurity policy. For example, she must decide what systems and data to protect, how best to secure them, what countermeasures to deploy against attacks, and which employees should have access to sensitive information. She also needs to keep up with the latest threats and vulnerabilities so that her policy remains effective.	strategic planning and policy development	Use an analogy to explain strategic planning and policy development (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a castle with walls and a moat. The walls are the cybersecurity measures that you put in place, such as firewalls and antivirus software. The moat is the gap between your network and the internet, which helps to keep unauthorized users out.	subject	Use an analogy to explain subject (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a fortress. It's strong and can protect you from harm, but it takes time to build and maintain.	subject	Use an analogy to explain subject (cybersecurity).
One analogy for cybersecurity is to think of it as a fortified city. The walls are the security measures that protect the inhabitants (the data) within. The guards are the people who monitor and manage the security systems, while the gates control access in and out of the city. Just like with any other city, there are different levels of security needed depending on what is being protected. For example, a small town might only need a few guards at the gate, while a large city would need more extensive security measures, such as cameras and alarms.	subject	Use an analogy to explain subject (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a locked door. The lock (cybersecurity) keeps unauthorized people from entering the house (network).	subject	Use an analogy to explain subject (cybersecurity).

In the event of a problem, the system intervenes to correct it.	supervisory control and data acquisition	Use an analogy to explain supervisory control and data acquisition (cybersecurity).
Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) is cybersecurity for industrial control systems. It is the process of monitoring, controlling, and recording devices in an industrial system.	supervisory control and data acquisition	Use an analogy to explain supervisory control and data acquisition (cybersecurity).
One analogy for supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) cybersecurity is that of a car. The driver (supervisor) monitors the engine, fuel, speed, and other systems while the car is in motion. If something goes wrong, the driver can make adjustments to keep things running smoothly. In a similar way, SCADA cybersecurity involves monitoring and managing industrial control systems to maintain operations safely and securely.	supervisory control and data acquisition	Use an analogy to explain supervisory control and data acquisition (cybersecurity).

Attackers may try to exploit vulnerabilities at any point in the supply chain, but if all links are strong, it will be much harder for them to succeed.	supply chain	Use an analogy to explain supply chain (cybersecurity).
Supply chain (cybersecurity) can be analogized to the body’s immune system. Just as the immune system fights off disease and helps protect the body, a well-functioning supply chain cybersecurity program protects an organization from cyberattacks and defends its valuable data. Like the human immune system, a strong supply chain cybersecurity program has numerous layers of protection, employs multiple security technologies, and utilizes best practices to keep cybercriminals at bay.	supply chain	Use an analogy to explain supply chain (cybersecurity).
A supply chain is a network of organizations that are involved in the process of making and delivering a product or service to consumers. The term "supply chain" usually refers to the flow of goods and materials, but can also include information and finances. Just as there are physical threats to products in the physical world (theft, vandalism, natural disasters), there are also threats to products in the digital world. These threats can come from malware attacks, cyber espionage, data breaches, etc. A strong cybersecurity strategy is essential for protecting your company's valuable intellectual property and ensuring that your products reach consumers safe and sound.	supply chain	Use an analogy to explain supply chain (cybersecurity).
Supply chain cybersecurity is like a three-legged stool. The first leg is protecting your organization's own systems. The second leg is working with trusted partners to protect their systems and the information they share with you. The third leg is using security measures to protect the data that moves between your organization and its partners.	supply chain	Use an analogy to explain supply chain (cybersecurity).
A supply chain can be thought of as a series of links in a chain, where each link is an organization that provides a product or service to the next link in the chain.

For example, if one company in the supply chain is hacked, the hacker may be able to access information or products from other companies in the supply chain.	supply chain	Use an analogy to explain supply chain (cybersecurity).
Supply chain risk management can be thought of as a cyber-security strategy for organizations. Just as businesses need to protect their computer networks and data from being hacked, they also need to protect the systems that support their operations (e.g., production lines, suppliers’ networks, delivery channels). A breach in any part of the supply chain could have serious consequences for the organization, including lost revenue, damaged reputation, and increased costs. By implementing sound security practices throughout the supply chain, businesses can better safeguard against disruptions and mitigate the risks associated with cyber threats.	supply chain risk management	Use an analogy to explain supply chain risk management (cybersecurity).
A supply chain is like a grocery store. The store has many different sections, such as produce, meat, and dairy. Each section has its own set of risks that the store manager must manage. For example, the manager must ensure that the produce is fresh and that the meat isn't going bad. The same concept applies to a company's supply chain. The company must manage different types of risk, such as product quality risk and cybersecurity risk.	supply chain risk management	Use an analogy to explain supply chain risk management (cybersecurity).
Supply chain risk management is like securing a castle. Just as medieval castles had to protect their inhabitants from invaders, supply chains have to secure their digital systems and data from hackers and cybercriminals.

Symmetric encryption algorithms use a shared secret (the key) to encrypt and decrypt data.	symmetric encryption algorithm	Use an analogy to explain symmetric encryption algorithm (cybersecurity).
A symmetric-key algorithm uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. Think of this key as a lock that can be opened by either a right or left hand. The sender and receiver both have copies of this key, and use it to encrypt and decrypt messages between them. This is an example of symmetric cryptography, which is more commonly used than asymmetric cryptography because it is faster and simpler.	symmetric encryption algorithm	Use an analogy to explain symmetric encryption algorithm (cybersecurity).

Cybersecurity is like being a system administrator for a business. As a system administrator, you are responsible for the security of the systems and data in your organization. You need to make sure that the systems are secure from unauthorized access and use, and that the data is protected from unauthorized disclosure or destruction. You also need to make sure that the systems are reliable and available when needed.	system administration	Use an analogy to explain system administration (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is a lot like traffic management. Just as city planners have to consider the flow of cars, buses and bicycles when they’re designing new roads, system administrators need to think about the way data moves around in order to keep things running smoothly. They also need to be prepared for unexpected events, like an influx of people trying to use the internet at once or a power outage.	system administration	Use an analogy to explain system administration (cybersecurity).
Just as a doctor is responsible for the overall health of a patient, a system administrator is responsible for the overall security and stability of an organization's computer systems.

Cybersecurity is like a house with a strong foundation. If the foundation is weak, the house will eventually crumble, no matter how well it is built. The same is true for cybersecurity; if your system has a weak foundation, it can be easily compromised by cyber attacks. That's why it's so important to have a robust cybersecurity strategy in place that protects your system from vulnerabilities.	system integrity	Use an analogy to explain system integrity (cybersecurity).
It can be helpful to think of systems development (cybersecurity) as similar to constructing a house. The first step is to develop a plan or blueprint for the house. This plan will outline what materials are needed and how the house will be constructed. Next, the raw materials must be gathered and the construction process begins. Throughout the build, various workers will need to complete specific tasks in order for the house to be completed. There may be some issues that arise during construction, but these can usually be addressed and corrected as they come up. Once the house is finished, it needs to be furnished and made ready for living in. In many cases, this also includes landscaping around the property. Just like building a house, developing a cybersecurity program involves planning, gathering resources, assembling teams of experts, and completing tasks with occasional setbacks along the way. Like any good security program, your cybersecurity infrastructure should evolve over time in response to new threats and vulnerabilities discovered in your environment	systems development	Use an analogy to explain systems development (cybersecurity).
Systems development is like baking a cake. The ingredients (like code, tools and processes) are mixed together to form the batter. This is then put in the oven to bake. As it cooks, the cake rises and takes on its final shape. Once it's done, you can frost and decorate it however you like.	systems development	Use an analogy to explain systems development (cybersecurity).
Systems development can be likened to the construction of a house. A blueprint is created and followed as workers construct walls, install windows and roofing, and paint the finished product. In much the same way, a plan for developing a secure information system is drawn up and followed as various security measures are put in place. Just as with building a house, there may be changes or glitches along the way, but by following a set plan, the final goal is more likely to be reached.	systems development	Use an analogy to explain systems development (cybersecurity).
Systems development can be likened to the construction of a house. The blueprint for the house is created, and then the construction crew begins to build it according to those plans. During this process, they might make changes as they go along based on what they discover (e.g., there's not enough room for a bedroom on the second floor, so they add one). Once the house is finished, it's inspected to ensure that it meets all code requirements. In cybersecurity, systems development would refer to building a new system or modifying an existing system. The blueprints would be the security design documentation, and the construction crew would be the developers who are implementing that design. As with actual construction, things may change as developers work on implementation and come across unforeseen issues. And just like with houses, it's important to have someone inspect completed systems to ensure that they meet all security requirements	systems development	Use an analogy to explain systems development (cybersecurity).
Systems development can be thought of as building a house. The first step is to plan the house, including deciding what it will look like and how big it will be. Next, the foundation is laid and the framing goes up. Once the walls are in place, insulation and drywall are added. Then comes wiring, plumbing, and finally furniture and decorations.	systems development	Use an analogy to explain systems development (cybersecurity).
Asking what are the system requirements for a new car is much like asking what are the cybersecurity requirements for a new company. Just as you would need to know how many passengers the car can seat, how fast it goes, and how fuel efficient it is, you would need to know things like how many employees your company has, what kind of data they store, and how frequently that data changes. You'd also want to make sure that your car could handle rugged terrain if you planned on using it off-road. In the same way, you'd want to ensure that your cybersecurity plan can protect against cyberattacks no matter where they come from or what form they take.	systems requirements planning	Use an analogy to explain systems requirements planning (cybersecurity).
Systems Requirements Planning (cybersecurity) is like building a house. The first step is to figure out what you want the house to look like and what features it will have. Next, you need to determine how much it will cost to build and how long it will take. After that, you need to gather all of the materials you will need and start construction. During construction, you may come across unexpected problems or challenges that require adjustments to your plans. Once the house is completed, you need to make sure everything works properly and address any final issues.	systems requirements planning	Use an analogy to explain systems requirements planning (cybersecurity).
System requirements planning can be likened to baking a cake. The baker has a recipe that calls for specific ingredients in certain quantities. If any of the ingredients are missing or not measurement accurate, the cake will not turn out as planned. The same is true for systems requirements planning - if critical components are missing or inaccurate, the resulting system may not function as intended.	systems requirements planning	Use an analogy to explain systems requirements planning (cybersecurity).
Systems requirements planning can be best described as laying out the groundwork for a construction project. Just as an architect needs to plan and design a project before any building can take place, so too does a cybersecurity professional need to map out and plan their organization's security infrastructure. This includes creating blueprints of the network, specifying what hardware and software will be used, and outlining the steps that need to be taken in order to protect against cyberattacks.	systems requirements planning	Use an analogy to explain systems requirements planning (cybersecurity).
System requirements planning is like building a house. The first step is to figure out what you want your house to look like, what features it will have, and how much it will cost. Once you have that figured out, you can start designing the blueprint for your house and figuring out what materials you need to build it. Then, once the construction process begins, you need to make sure that everyone involved in building the house knows what they're supposed to be doing and are following the plan correctly. The same goes for cybersecurity: before you can start securing your network, you need to know what your security goals are and identify which systems need protection. Then, put together a plan detailing how those systems will be secured and make sure everyone who needs access to them understands their role in keeping them safe.	systems requirements planning	Use an analogy to explain systems requirements planning (cybersecurity).
System security analysis is similar to investigating a crime scene. Just as detectives collect evidence and try to piece together what happened, cybersecurity analysts do the same with digital systems. They look for signs of malicious activity, such as malware or unauthorized access, and work to find the perpetrators. By understanding how attackers operate, they can develop strategies to protect against future attacks.	systems security analysis	Use an analogy to explain systems security analysis (cybersecurity).
System security analysis is like a physical security system for your home. You have various cameras set up around the outside of your house, and whenever someone approaches, the camera sends you a notification so that you can see who it is. You also have a lock on your door, which requires a key to open. If someone tries to open the door without the key, they won't be able to get in. In the same way, system security analysts use various tools to monitor activity on networks and systems and identify any suspicious or unauthorized behavior. They also use passwords and other measures to protect systems from unauthorized access.	systems security analysis	Use an analogy to explain systems security analysis (cybersecurity).
Just as a doctor would need to do a physical examination of a person to determine what is wrong, in order to properly secure a computer system, it is important to analyze all aspects of the system and its environment. This includes looking at things like the hardware and software that are used, as well as how users interact with the system. By understanding how the different parts of the system work together, you can identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.	systems security analysis	Use an analogy to explain systems security analysis (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity is like a fortress with walls, gates, and guards. The walls are the security measures that keep out unauthorized people, the gates are the entry points where people come in, and the guards are the security personnel who screen everyone who enters. In order to get into the fortress, you need to go through the gates and be approved by the guards.	systems security analysis	Use an analogy to explain systems security analysis (cybersecurity).
System security analysis is like a doctor examining a patient. The doctor looks at the patient's symptoms and tries to find the cause of the problem. Then, the doctor recommends a treatment plan to fix the problem.	systems security analysis	Use an analogy to explain systems security analysis (cybersecurity).
A system security architecture can be analogized to the walls and gates of a medieval castle. Just as the walls and gates protect the inhabitants of the castle from invaders, a system security architecture protects the data and systems within an organization from unauthorized access. The walls are like the firewall, which blocks unauthorized access to data and systems. The gates are like authentication mechanisms, which verify that users are who they say they are before allowing them access to data or systems.	systems security architecture	Use an analogy to explain systems security architecture (cybersecurity).
A system security architecture can be thought of as a castle with high walls, a moat and drawbridge. The walls are the perimeter defense, the moat is the intrusion detection system (IDS) and the drawbridge is the authentication gateway. The purpose of these defenses is to keep unauthorized users out of the castle.	systems security architecture	Use an analogy to explain systems security architecture (cybersecurity).
Just as the walls, roof, and foundation of a house keep inhabitants safe and secure, so too do the various systems and networks that comprise a company's cybersecurity architecture. Security features such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), anti-virus software, and user authentication protocols work together to protect data from unauthorized access or theft. By carefully planning and designing their security infrastructure, companies can mitigate the risk of cyberattacks and ensure the safety of their proprietary information.	systems security architecture	Use an analogy to explain systems security architecture (cybersecurity).
A systems security architecture can be thought of as a building's security system. Just as the architect designs the building to protect its inhabitants from harm, a cybersecurity professional designs a company's computer networks to protect them from unauthorized access and cyberattacks.	systems security architecture	Use an analogy to explain systems security architecture (cybersecurity).
Just as an architect designs a physical structure to protect people and property, a systems security architect (cybersecurity) designs the network infrastructure and security controls to protect information and systems. The goal is to create a secure environment that meets the organization's requirements while minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or damage.	systems security architecture	Use an analogy to explain systems security architecture (cybersecurity).
A tabletop exercise is like a game of Risk where different players represent different parts of an organization, such as the board of directors, executives, information technology staff, and line-of-business managers. The objective is to identify potential problems and vulnerabilities during a simulated crisis and develop solutions.	tabletop exercise	Use an analogy to explain tabletop exercise (cybersecurity).
A tabletop exercise is like a practice drill for a fire department. During a tabletop exercise, the emergency responders gather around a table and pretend to respond to a mock emergency. They discuss how they would handle the situation and make decisions about what steps to take. This helps them prepare for an actual emergency by identifying potential problems and strategizing how to address them.	tabletop exercise	Use an analogy to explain tabletop exercise (cybersecurity).
A tabletop exercise is like a practice drill in which people act out a potential cyberattack. Just as you would run through different possible scenarios with your team during an emergency situation, tabletop exercises allow you to do the same when it comes to cybersecurity. By doing this, you can identify potential weak spots and figure out how best to protect your systems if and when an attack does occur.	tabletop exercise	Use an analogy to explain tabletop exercise (cybersecurity).
A tabletop exercise is like a practice run for a real-life situation. For example, if you are going to be in an emergency room setting, you may have a tabletop exercise to help prepare for the potential chaos that could occur. In the same way, cybersecurity professionals may use tabletop exercises to help them plan and prepare for potential cyberattacks.	tabletop exercise	Use an analogy to explain tabletop exercise (cybersecurity).
A tabletop exercise is like a practice drill for a football team. The players run through the plays they would use in a game, and the coaches watch to see how well they work. In the same way, tabletop exercises allow organizations to test their cybersecurity plans by simulating an attack or other incident. This helps identify any gaps in their security posture and allows them to address these before an actual breach occurs.	tabletop exercise	Use an analogy to explain tabletop exercise (cybersecurity).
Just as it is important for a person to have tailored clothing that fits well, it is important for an organization to have tailored cybersecurity solutions that fit their specific needs. A trusted space must be carefully tailored to protect the most sensitive data and systems while still allowing authorized users access to the information they need. Organizations that take the time to tailor trustworthy space specifically for their needs will be better protected against cyberattacks.	tailored trustworthy space	Use an analogy to explain tailored trustworthy space (cybersecurity).
A tailored trustworthy space can be thought of as a custom-made suit that fits you perfectly. It's made to your exact measurements and takes into account all of your specific needs. The same is true for cybersecurity - it's customized to fit the individual organization and its specific requirements. This means that the security solution is unique to each company, and provides exactly what they need in order to keep their data safe.	tailored trustworthy space	Use an analogy to explain tailored trustworthy space (cybersecurity).
A tailor takes a piece of cloth and cuts it to fit the person who will be wearing it. In the same way, tailored trustworthy space means that the cybersecurity measures in place are specifically designed for the organization they protect. The security is not a one-size-fits-all approach, but instead is customized to meet the specific needs of the business.	tailored trustworthy space	Use an analogy to explain tailored trustworthy space (cybersecurity).
If you think of your computer as a house, the tailored trustworthy space would be like having a security system installed in your home. This would include things like alarms, cameras, and sensors that are all specifically designed to protect your home from intruders. In the same way, using tailored trustworthy space for cybersecurity can help protect your computer from online threats by providing specific protection that is customized for your needs.	tailored trustworthy space	Use an analogy to explain tailored trustworthy space (cybersecurity).
A trustworthy space could be thought of as a tailored suit. The suit fits you perfectly because it is made specifically for your body. Your trust in the suit comes from the knowledge that it has been created with your specific measurements and only for you. A trustworthy space in cyberspace works in a similar way. It is customized to meet the unique needs of your organization, providing a safer and more secure environment for your data and users.	tailored trustworthy space	Use an analogy to explain tailored trustworthy space (cybersecurity).
Hitting a bullseye on a target with a bow and arrow is analogous to cybersecurity's goal of protecting an organization's information technology (IT) infrastructure by mitigating risk and vulnerability. Just as archers must take into account the wind speed, direction, and other environmental conditions when aiming for their target, cybersecurity professionals must similarly factor in potential risks when deploying security measures. Like arrows shot at a bulls-eye, successful cyberattacks can be precise and devastating.	targets	Use an analogy to explain targets (cybersecurity).
Hitting a bulls-eye on a target is easier than hitting a target that is off to the side. In cybersecurity, targets are networks or devices that are more likely to be attacked because they offer an opportunity for the attacker to gain something, such as access to confidential data. Off-target systems may not have anything of value to the attacker, so they are less likely to be targeted.	targets	Use an analogy to explain targets (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity targets can be compared to a fortress. The walls of the fortress protect the people and goods inside from physical harm, while cybersecuity target protect the organization's computer systems from digital threats. Just as attackers can use various methods to breach the walls of a fortress, hackers can use different techniques to attack an organization's computer systems.	targets	Use an analogy to explain targets (cybersecurity).
A target in the context of cybersecurity is an entity, such as a computer or network, that is at risk of being attacked. Organizations put themselves in the crosshairs of cybercriminals by failing to take the necessary precautions to secure their systems and data. As a result, they become easier targets for hackers who want to steal information, disrupt operations, or hold them ransom.	targets	Use an analogy to explain targets (cybersecurity).
When you go out to shoot arrows at a target, you have a specific goal in mind. You want to hit the bullseye. In the same way, when you're trying to protect your cybersecurity, you have specific targets that you're aiming for. These can include things like protecting your passwords and keeping your computer software up-to-date. By focusing on these key targets, you can help keep your cybersecurity strong.	targets	Use an analogy to explain targets (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity research and development would be like the police department constantly researching new ways to prevent crime and catching criminals. They would be looking at things like new technology that could help them in their investigations, as well as studying different types of crime so they can stay ahead of the curve.	technology research and development	Use an analogy to explain technology research and development (cybersecurity).
Technology research and development can be likened to solving a Rubik's Cube. The researcher or developer is like the puzzle solver, diligently trying different combinations of moves in an attempt to restore the cube to its original color pattern. Just as with the Rubik's Cube, some technology research and development problems are more difficult than others and may take longer to solve. However, with patience and perseverance, even the most complex challenges can eventually be overcome.	technology research and development	Use an analogy to explain technology research and development (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity research and development can be thought of as like creating a new vaccine. Scientists must experiment with different viruses, bacteria, and cells to find the right combination to create a vaccine that is both safe and effective. Cybersecurity researchers do the same thing but with computer code instead of viruses. They must try out different software combinations to find one that is secure and will protect against cyberattacks.	technology research and development	Use an analogy to explain technology research and development (cybersecurity).
Technology research and development can be thought of as a "cybersecurity race." Just like in a foot race, the goal is to cross the finish line before your opponents do. In cybersecurity, this means deploying new technologies and solutions before hackers can exploit them. It's a constant battle between defenders and attackers, with both sides constantly evolving their strategies.	technology research and development	Use an analogy to explain technology research and development (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity research and development can be likened to the process of designing a new car. Researchers first come up with an idea for a new model, then they design and build a prototype. They test the prototype in lab conditions and on the road to see how it performs. Once any necessary tweaks have been made, the car goes into mass production.	technology research and development	Use an analogy to explain technology research and development (cybersecurity).
Testing and Evaluation can be analogized to the process of baking a cake. The first step is to assemble all the necessary ingredients, followed by mixing them together. In order to ensure that the cake will turn out correctly, it is important to do some preliminary testing - such as checking whether the oven is preheated properly and that the batter has been mixed thoroughly. Finally, once everything looks good, it's time to put the cake in the oven and let it bake. After a set amount of time has passed, you take it out and let it cool down so that you can enjoy your delicious creation!	test and evaluation	Use an analogy to explain test and evaluation (cybersecurity).
Testing and evaluation can be thought of as a car. The car has many different parts, each of which needs to be tested and evaluated separately in order to ensure that the car functions as a whole. Cybersecurity is similar in that it is made up of many different components (e.g., firewalls, anti-virus software, etc.), each of which needs to be tested and evaluated in order to ensure the overall cybersecurity posture of an organization.	test and evaluation	Use an analogy to explain test and evaluation (cybersecurity).
A cybersecurity test is like a doctor checking your vital signs. The test measures different aspects of the system to see how it responds. A cybersecurity evaluation is like giving you a diagnosis after the check-up. It tells you what is wrong with the system and how to fix it.	test and evaluation	Use an analogy to explain test and evaluation (cybersecurity).
Testing and evaluation can be thought of as a bridge. The purpose of the bridge is to safely transport people and goods from one side to the other. To do this, the bridge needs to be tested to make sure it can withstand weight and traffic loads. Evaluation is then done after the testing is complete to see how well the bridge performed and if any changes need to be made.	test and evaluation	Use an analogy to explain test and evaluation (cybersecurity).
Testing and evaluation is like a carpenter using a level to make sure a shelf is straight. The carpenter uses the level to ensure that the shelf will not wobble or fall over, which could cause damage or injuries. Similarly, testers use various tools and techniques to test software for security vulnerabilities. By identifying and addressing these vulnerabilities early in the development process, organizations can help prevent cyberattacks that could cause damage or injure users.	test and evaluation	Use an analogy to explain test and evaluation (cybersecurity).
A virus is like a threat in that it can cause damage or harm to a computer. just like how a virus can infect and spread throughout a computer, cyber-threats can do the same to networks.	threat	Use an analogy to explain threat (cybersecurity).
A cyberattack can be thought of as a burglary. Just like with any other crime, there is always the potential for someone to try and break into your home or business in order to steal your possessions. However, by taking some simple steps to improve your security, you can make it much more difficult for criminals to succeed and help protect yourself from becoming a victim.	threat	Use an analogy to explain threat (cybersecurity).
A cybersecurity threat is similar to a burglar alarm. Both are devices that are used to protect something from being damaged or stolen. A burglar alarm goes off when someone tries to break into your house, and a cybersecurity threat goes off when someone tries to hack into your computer.	threat	Use an analogy to explain threat (cybersecurity).
Threat (cybersecurity) is like a robber trying to break into your house. The robber is the threat and your locked door is the security.	threat	Use an analogy to explain threat (cybersecurity).
Threat can be likened to a robber trying to break into your home. The robber is the threat and your locked door is the security measure. As long as the door remains closed, the robber cannot get inside and threaten you or your belongings. However, if the robber manages to break through the door, he will have free access to what's inside and can do whatever he wants. In cybersecurity terms, this would be like a hacker managing to gain access to your computer system or data. Once they're in, they can do whatever they want - including stealing your information or damaging your systems.	threat	Use an analogy to explain threat (cybersecurity).
A threat actor can be analogy as an intruder who illegally enters a building. Once inside, the intruder could cause damage or steal property. In the context of cybersecurity, a threat actor is someone who uses malicious methods to gain access to computer systems and networks with the intention of causing harm.	threat actor	Use an analogy to explain threat actor (cybersecurity).
Threat actors can be thought of as burglars. Just like a burglar is someone who poses a threat to your home and security, a threat actor is someone who poses a threat to your cybersecurity and online safety.

Threat analysis can be thought of as akin to a police officer on patrol. The police officer is constantly looking for potential threats, such as someone with a gun walking down the street. In order to do their job effectively, they need to be aware of the different types of threats that could occur and have a plan in place for how to deal with them.Similarly, in cybersecurity, organizations need to be aware of the different types of cyberthreats that could occur and have plans in place for how to deal with them. This includes things like having strong passwords and security measures in place, being vigilant about phishing scams, and keeping your software up-to-date.	threat analysis	Use an analogy to explain threat analysis (cybersecurity).
Threat analysis is like a map. It helps you understand the risks and potential threats in your environment so that you can take steps to protect yourself from harm.	threat analysis	Use an analogy to explain threat analysis (cybersecurity).
Threat analysis is like a trip to the grocery store. Before you go, you need to make a list of what you need and figure out how much money you have to spend. You also need to decide what kind of foods you want to eat while you're there. In the same way, before you start surfing the internet, you should think about what websites or activities are most important to you and create a list of "must-haves" that will help keep your information safe. You'll also want to consider how much money (or time) you're willing to spend on security measures.	threat analysis	Use an analogy to explain threat analysis (cybersecurity).
Threat analysis (cybersecurity) can be likened to a thief looking for weaknesses in a store's security system. The thief is constantly looking for ways to exploit any vulnerabilities that may exist so that they can gain access to the store's inventory and/or cash registers. In the same way, cybercriminals are always on the lookout for vulnerabilities in computing systems so that they can steal data or financial information, or install malware onto vulnerable systems.	threat analysis	Use an analogy to explain threat analysis (cybersecurity).
Threat analysis is like a security guard at a bank. The security guard's job is to watch the people coming into the building and look for anything or anyone that seems suspicious. They might be looking for someone who looks like they're up to no good, or someone who might be trying to steal something from the bank.	threat analysis	Use an analogy to explain threat analysis (cybersecurity).
Threat assessment is like a security guard at a bank. The security guard's job is to look for suspicious behavior and potential threats to the safety of the bank and its employees. If the security guard sees something that looks dangerous, he or she will take action to protect the bank. In the same way, threat assessment in cybersecurity is all about identifying potential threats to your computer systems and taking steps to protect them from harm.	threat assessment	Use an analogy to explain threat assessment (cybersecurity).
Threat assessment can be analogized to personal security. Just as one takes precautions such as installing locks, an alarm system, and perhaps even a guard dog in order to secure their home from intruders, individuals and organizations must take similar steps to secure their digital assets. This includes assessing potential threats, implementing preventative measures, and preparing for incidents should they occur.	threat assessment	Use an analogy to explain threat assessment (cybersecurity).
A threat assessment for cybersecurity is like a doctor diagnosing an illness. The doctor will ask a series of questions to try and determine the cause of the problem. They will also look at the symptoms to come up with a diagnosis. Cybersecurity professionals use the same approach when assessing threats. They will ask questions about the attack, such as how it was carried out and what type of malware was used. They will also look at any evidence that is available, such as IP addresses or file hashes.	threat assessment	Use an analogy to explain threat assessment (cybersecurity).
One analogy for threat assessment (cybersecurity) is that it is like a “zoo”. Just as you would take different precautions when visiting a zoo, such as watching where you walk so you don’t step on an animal and get bitten, being aware of your surroundings, and not sticking your hand into places where you can’t see what’s inside, so too must one be vigilant about potential cyber threats when conducting business online. One needs to be aware of the risks associated with clicking on unknown links, opening unexpected emails, or downloading files from untrusted sources. Just as animals in a zoo can pose physical dangers to visitors, cybercriminals can exploit vulnerabilities in order to steal data or money, or infect devices with malware.	threat assessment	Use an analogy to explain threat assessment (cybersecurity).
When you think about your personal safety, you may consider things like the neighborhood you live in, how safe it is and if there are any dangerous areas. You also might think about whether or not you're likely to be targeted for a crime.

Threat assessment helps organizations prioritize their security efforts by identifying the most serious threats and taking steps to mitigate them.	threat assessment	Use an analogy to explain threat assessment (cybersecurity).
When you go to a movie theater, you purchase a ticket from the box office. This entitles you to see one movie. The ticket is like your cybersecurity authorization—it proves that you are authorized to access the systems and data that you need. Just as importantly, it also records when and where you accessed those systems and data so that you can be held accountable if something goes wrong.	ticket	Use an analogy to explain ticket (cybersecurity).
A ticket is like a digital key that can be used to unlock or access something. In the case of cybersecurity, it might be a password or code that allows you to log in to your email account or bank website. Without the ticket (key), you can't get into whatever it is you're trying to access.	ticket	Use an analogy to explain ticket (cybersecurity).
A ticket is like a cybersecurity certificate. It is an electronic document that proves you are who you say you are.	ticket	Use an analogy to explain ticket (cybersecurity).

Similarly, cybersecurity tickets are permits that allow someone to access or use certain computer systems or networks.	ticket	Use an analogy to explain ticket (cybersecurity).
If you think of red lights as a warning to stop, green lights as a signal to proceed and yellow lights as a caution, then traffic light protocol is very similar to the way we use traffic signals in the physical world. Just like on the street, when it comes to cybersecurity we need protocols in place that will help keep us safe while still allowing us to move forward with our digital lives.	traffic light protocol	Use an analogy to explain traffic light protocol (cybersecurity).
Red light protocol is the equivalent of a stop sign in cybersecurity. It means that all traffic (data) must come to a complete stop until it can be authorized by a green light. Yellow lights are used as warnings, and typically indicate that data should slow down but may continue if there is no risk involved.	traffic light protocol	Use an analogy to explain traffic light protocol (cybersecurity).
Red light: stopGreen light: go Yellow light: proceed with caution	traffic light protocol	Use an analogy to explain traffic light protocol (cybersecurity).
Traffic light protocol is like the stoplights we see on the road. Red means to stop, yellow means to prepare to stop, and green means go. In cybersecurity, red would mean that a computer or network is not safe to use and should be avoided, yellow would mean that some caution should be taken when using the device or network, and green would mean that it is safe to use.	traffic light protocol	Use an analogy to explain traffic light protocol (cybersecurity).
A traffic light analogy for cybersecurity is the use of stoplights to control the flow of traffic. In the same way, a cybersecurity system uses various measures - such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and user authentication - to control and monitor access to information systems and protect them from unauthorized access or attacks.	traffic light protocol	Use an analogy to explain traffic light protocol (cybersecurity).
A trojan horse is a type of malware that tricks users into installing it by appearing to be something else, such as a harmless file or software update. Once installed, the trojan can exploit vulnerabilities in the system to gain control and steal data or inflict other damage.	trojan horse	Use an analogy to explain trojan horse (cybersecurity).
Trojan horse is an analogy for a cybersecurity threat that enters a computer or network undetected. The analogy is of the Trojan Horse from Greek mythology, which was used by the Greeks to infiltrate and defeat the city of Troy. In cybersecurity, a trojan horse is a malicious program that appears to be something else (such as a legitimate software update), but instead contains hidden code that allows attackers access to or control over the target system.	trojan horse	Use an analogy to explain trojan horse (cybersecurity).
