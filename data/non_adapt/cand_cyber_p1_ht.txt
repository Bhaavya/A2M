If you have a key to a door, that means you can access whatever is behind the door. If someone else has a key to the same door, they can also access what's behind it. Cybersecurity is similar in that it's all about having access to certain information or systems. If someone has the right permissions or security clearance, they can access whatever is inside the system.	access	Explain access (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Access can be best likened to a key. A key is the means by which an individual gains entry into a locked structure. In the cybersecurity context, access controls are the methods by which entities (such as users, systems, or data) are permitted entrance into computer systems and networks. Just as keys can be lost, stolen, or copied without authorization, so too can access credentials be abused if they fall into the wrong hands.	access	Explain access (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One way to think of access is as a key that unlocks a door. In the context of cybersecurity, access controls allow authorized users to gain entry into specific systems or data repositories, while preventing unauthorized access by others. Access can be granted through the use of usernames and passwords, or through other authentication mechanisms such as biometrics.	access	Explain access (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Access is similar to a key. A key can be used to unlock a door, giving access to the room on the other side. In cybersecurity, access refers to the ability to use certain tools or systems in order to do something, such as accessing data or changing settings.	access	Explain access (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Think of access as a key. The key unlocks the door to your house so you can go inside. Access controls are like locks on the doors of your house. They keep people from entering without the key.	access	Explain access (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Access and identity management is like a bouncer at a club. They are in charge of letting people into the club and verifying that they are allowed to be there. They also keep track of who is in the club and make sure that everyone is following the rules.	access and identity management	Explain access and identity management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One way to think of access and identity management is as a set of locks on your house. You need a key to unlock each lock, and each person who needs access to your house has their own key. The keys are unique, so you can be sure that only the people who should have access can get in. Access and identity management systems work in much the same way: they use unique identifiers (like usernames and passwords) to control who can do what online.	access and identity management	Explain access and identity management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Access and identity management is similar to a bouncer at a club. The bouncer checks IDs to make sure that everyone in the club is of legal drinking age and then allows people into the club accordingly. Access and identity management systems work similarly by verifying the identities of users and granting them access to resources based on their credentials.	access and identity management	Explain access and identity management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Analogy: Access and identity management can be thought of as a bouncer at a club. They are in charge of verifying that everyone who enters the club is allowed to do so. They also keep track of who is in the club and what they are doing. This helps to ensure that only authorized people are in the club and that everyone is safe.	access and identity management	Explain access and identity management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Access management is like a bouncer at the door of a club. They are in charge of letting people into the club, and they make sure that only authorized people are allowed in. Identity management is like a ID card. It proves that you are who you say you are, and it allows access to certain areas or information only if you are authorized to have it.	access and identity management	Explain access and identity management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One way to think of access control is as a fence around your property. You might have a locked gate with a code that only you and your family know. This would keep out unauthorized people while still allowing you and your family access. Access control in cybersecurity is very similar. It’s all about limiting who can access what, and making sure only authorized users are able to do so.	access control	Explain access control (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
You are a homeowner with a key to your front door. You can enter your house any time you want, without having to ask anyone for permission. This is an example of unrestricted access. Now imagine that you add a security system to your home with a keypad. To get into your house, you now need to enter a code on the keypad. This is an example of restricted access. Only people who have the code can get into your house.	access control	Explain access control (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you think of computer security as a building, then access control would be the doors and locks. Access control is what prevents unauthorized people from getting into a secure area. In cybersecurity, access control is used to restrict access to sensitive data and systems.	access control	Explain access control (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Access control can be thought of as a bouncer at a nightclub. They are responsible for deciding who is allowed into the club and who is not. Access control in cybersecurity is similar, it is responsible for deciding which users or devices are allowed access to a network or system and which ones are not.	access control	Explain access control (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
There are many ways to think of access control, but one analogy is that it is like a guard at the door of a building. The guard checks the identification of everyone who wants to enter and only allows those people inside who are supposed to be there. Access control in cybersecurity works in a similar way. It uses security measures like passwords and authentication codes to make sure only authorized users can access your computer or network.	access control	Explain access control (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A person's access to a room is regulated by a security guard who checks the person's identification. The security guard will only allow people with authorized identification into the room. In the same way, a computer system uses an access control mechanism to regulate which users are allowed access to its resources.	access control mechanism	Explain access control mechanism (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Access control mechanisms are like bouncers at a night club. They are there to ensure that only authorized people are allowed into the club, and they do this by checking identification cards or passports. In the same way, access control mechanisms in cybersecurity work to ensure that only authorized users are able to access data and systems. They do this by verifying user credentials (e.g., usernames and passwords) or using other authentication methods such as biometrics.	access control mechanism	Explain access control mechanism (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One can think of access control mechanisms as locks on a door. The lock restricts access to the room (or data) behind it to those with the key (authorization). In this analogy, the key is a unique string of characters that identifies a specific user or group of users.	access control mechanism	Explain access control mechanism (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for access control is locking your door. You might have a key to the lock, or you might use a thumbturn. Either way, only people with access to the key or thumbturn can open the door. In cybersecurity, authentication (having something that only you should know) and authorization (granting permission to do something) play similar roles as the key and thumbturn in this analogy.	access control mechanism	Explain access control mechanism (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One way to think about access control is as a security guard at the door of a club. The security guard checks ID cards to make sure that only authorized people are allowed into the club. Access control mechanisms work in much the same way on computers, networks, and other systems. They restrict access to data and systems based on who is requesting access and whether they are authorized to have it.	access control mechanism	Explain access control mechanism (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Active attacks are like someone physically attacking your computer by trying to access it without permission. They are trying to get into your system and take control, just as a physical attacker would try to break into your home or office.	active attack	Explain active attack (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One way to think of an active attack is as a burglar trying to break into your house. The burglars (the attackers) use tools and techniques to try to get past your security measures (the defenders), such as locks, alarms, and cameras.	active attack	Explain active attack (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Active attacks are like someone breaking into your house and robbing you. They are deliberate attempts to exploit a system or network for personal gain.	active attack	Explain active attack (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One way to think of active attacks is as a burglar who is trying to break into your house. The attacker will try different ways to get in, such as picking the locks or smashing a window. Once inside, the attacker can steal your possessions or worse.	active attack	Explain active attack (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An active attack is like a home invasion. The attacker gains unauthorized access to your system and takes control over it, often deleting files or locking users out. They may also install malware to enable them to continue monitoring your activities or even take over other systems in your network.	active attack	Explain active attack (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Active content is like a virus in your computer. It can harm your device or steal your data.	active content	Explain active content (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Active content is similar to a loaded gun. It can be used for good or bad, depending on who is controlling it. In the context of cybersecurity, active content is any code that has the potential to cause harm, such as malware or viruses.	active content	Explain active content (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Active content is like a virus on your computer. It can harm your computer or steal your information.	active content	Explain active content (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An analogy for active content would be a car with the key in the ignition. Active content is something that can be easily accessed and turned on, just like how a car can be started with the key in the ignition. This makes it easy for someone to take advantage of active content and exploit it for their own purposes.	active content	Explain active content (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Active content is like a virus. It is something that can infect your computer and cause damage. Active content includes things like Flash, Java, and JavaScript. It can be used to create websites or add features to websites. But it can also be used to attack your computer.	active content	Explain active content (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Advanced persistent threat (APT) is like a thief that breaks into your home, steals your valuables, and then comes back several times over the next few weeks to steal more. The thief is advanced because they are able to break in undetected, they are persistent because they keep coming back even after you have taken steps to secure your home, and they are a threat because of the damage and havoc they can cause.	advanced persistent threat	Explain advanced persistent threat (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are like a virus that keeps coming back, even after you think you've gotten rid of it. They're designed to exploit vulnerabilities in your system and stay undetected for as long as possible.	advanced persistent threat	Explain advanced persistent threat (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a sophisticated cyberattack that is often difficult to detect and can remain active for an extended period of time. APTs are typically carried out by well-funded, state-sponsored actors or criminal organizations with extensive resources. They are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in networks and systems in order to steal data or gain access to sensitive information.	advanced persistent threat	Explain advanced persistent threat (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a cyberattack in which an unauthorized person gains access to a computer system and remains undetected for a long period of time. This type of attack is often carried out by skilled hackers who use sophisticated techniques to evade security measures.	advanced persistent threat	Explain advanced persistent threat (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a sustained cyberattack usually conducted by nation-state actors or sophisticated criminals with the intention of compromising a specific target. The goal may be to steal information, sabotage systems, or disrupt business operations. APTs are often difficult to detect and can persist for months or even years.	advanced persistent threat	Explain advanced persistent threat (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Adversaries in cybersecurity can be thought of as thieves who are trying to steal your information or damage your computer. Just like you would take steps to protect your house from a thief, you need to take steps to protect your computer and information from adversaries.	adversary	Explain adversary (cybersecurity) using an analogy.

An adversary is like a thief who tries to break into your house and steal your belongings.	adversary	Explain adversary (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An adversary is like a robber. They are trying to take something that doesn't belong to them, whether it's information or money.	adversary	Explain adversary (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Air gap is a term used in cybersecurity to describe the physical distance between a computer and the internet. This separation can be accomplished by unplugging a computer from the network, or placing it in an area that does not have an internet connection. Air gaps are often used as security measures to protect computers from outside threats.	air gap	Explain air gap (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Air gap is a security measure that separates a secure computer network from insecure networks, usually the public internet. Air gaps are often used in military and industrial settings to protect classified or sensitive data. An analogy would be to imagine two households, one with a fence around it and the other without. The household with the fence is more secure because it has an air gap between it and the outside world.	air gap	Explain air gap (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Air gap is a term used in cybersecurity to describe the physical separation of a computer or network from unsecured networks, such as the public Internet. An analogy would be keeping your computer in a locked room with no windows so that people on the outside cannot see what you are doing on your computer.	air gap	Explain air gap (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Air gap is an analogy that can be used to describe the separation of a secure network from an unsecured or less-secure network. The term "air gap" was originally coined by the military, where it refers to the physical separation of two networks through distance (e.g., on opposite sides of a room, building, or campus) or security measures (e.g., firewalls). In information technology, an air gap can also refer to the virtual separation of two systems, such as when one system is not connected to the internet.	air gap	Explain air gap (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cyber air gap is an isolated network that is not connected to the internet. This is used as a security measure to protect systems from being hacked. An analogy would be to imagine a computer in a room that is not connected to the internet. The computer can only be accessed by people who are in the room with it.	air gap	Explain air gap (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An alert in cybersecurity is the same as a warning siren going off. It means that something bad is happening and you need to take action immediately.	alert	Explain alert (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you receive an alert on your phone about a severe weather event, such as a tornado warning, you would know to take immediate action to protect yourself. An alert about a cybersecurity event is similar- it provides information about an ongoing or potential cyberattack so that you can take steps to protect your devices and data.	alert	Explain alert (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
When you see the red triangle on your car's dashboard, it means that something is wrong and you need to pull over and take a look. An alert in cybersecurity works in a similar way: It's an indication that something might be wrong and you should investigate further.	alert	Explain alert (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An alert in the cybersecurity world is much like an alarm going off in a physical world. It is something that draws attention to possible danger or risk.	alert	Explain alert (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you see a warning light go off in your car, you know that something is wrong and you need to take action. The same is true with cybersecurity alerts. When you see an alert pop up, it means that something bad has happened and you need to take immediate action to protect your computer or network.	alert	Explain alert (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity allowlist is similar to a white list in computer security. It is a list of allowed items, such as devices, users, files and applications that are approved for use on a network or computing system. The purpose of an allow list is to help protect networks and systems from unauthorized access or malicious activity by limiting the items that are permitted to connect to or operate on them.	allowlist	Explain allowlist (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An analogy for allowlist is a bouncer at a nightclub. The bouncer will only let in people who are on the list of people allowed into the club. Similarly, the allowlist will only let in traffic that is authorized to go to the desired destination.	allowlist	Explain allowlist (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An analogy for allowlist is a bouncer at a nightclub. The bouncer decides who can enter the club and who cannot. The bouncer uses his or her discretion to decide which people are allowed in and which people are not. Similarly, the allowlist is a list of devices that are allowed to connect to the network. Devices that are not on the allowlist will not be able to connect to the network.	allowlist	Explain allowlist (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity allowlist is a bit like the list of ingredients that are found on the back of food packages. The list tells you what is in the product and how much of each ingredient is used. Cybersecurity allowlists work in a similar way. They tell you which programs or websites can be accessed on your computer and how much access they have.	allowlist	Explain allowlist (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you think about it like a shopping list, the items in your house that you allow people to borrow are on an “allow list.” Your toothbrush, favorite coffee mug, and car keys are all examples of things that might be on your allow list. You might also have a rule that says only people who live with you can borrow these items. This is sort of how the allow list works in cybersecurity. It’s a list of devices or programs that you specifically allow to connect to your network.	allowlist	Explain allowlist (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Source intelligence (cybersecurity) can be analogized to a detective investigating a crime. The detective gathers information from all possible sources—witnesses, the victim, forensics, and so on—to try and piece together what happened. The same is true for cybersecurity: defenders gather information from all possible sources in order to understand how an attack occurred and who was behind it. This information can include network logs, malware samples, spear-phishing emails, and more. By analyzing this data, defenders can develop strategies to prevent future attacks.	all source intelligence	Explain all source intelligence (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Source intelligence can be thought of as the foundation of a building. Without well-defined and accurate source intelligence, it is difficult to build a strong security posture. Security analysts use various sources of information to identify threats, vulnerabilities, and risks. These sources might include threat reports from other organizations, indicators of compromise (IOCs), vulnerability scans, and penetration tests. By piecing together data from these different sources, analysts can develop a more comprehensive view of the organization's security posture and make better decisions about how to protect the organization's systems and data.	all source intelligence	Explain all source intelligence (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like a fortress protecting your valuable resources inside. The walls of the fortress are made up of various security technologies such as firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems. The gates of the fortress are protected by authentication mechanisms such as passwords and user IDs. Inside the fortress are the valuable resources that you want to protect such as your data, programs, and networks.	all source intelligence	Explain all source intelligence (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for cybersecurity is that it is like a locked room. The people inside the room are the ones with access to the things inside, and they can choose who else gets in. The door to the room can be opened by those within, or by someone with a key. Outside of the room, there are things happening—people trying to get in, listening at the door, and so on—but those events are happening outside of what’s going on in the room.	all source intelligence	Explain all source intelligence (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The intelligence community (IC) gathers information on potential threats to the United States. This information comes from a variety of sources, including human intelligence (HUMINT), signals intelligence (SIGINT), and image intelligence (IMINT). Cybersecurity is one part of this broader effort.Just as spies might collect information about an adversary's intentions by intercepting their conversations or reading their emails, cybersecurity experts monitor digital activity in order to identify potential threats. They look for signs of malicious activity, such as attempts to hack into networks or steal data.This information is then analyzed and used to develop strategies for defending against cyberattacks. The IC also shares intel with other government agencies and private companies so that they can protect themselves from online threats.	all source intelligence	Explain all source intelligence (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is a bit like locking your front door. You're doing it to keep people out, but you also know that if someone really wants to get in, they can probably find a way. So you use different locks for different entrances, and maybe add an alarm system too. And you keep your keys safe so no one can copy them and unlock the door without your permission.	analyze	Explain analyze (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A firewall is like a security guard for your computer. It stands watch and blocks unauthorized access, just like a security guard prevents people from entering your office building without permission.	analyze	Explain analyze (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The process of analyzing potential cyber threats and vulnerabilities is similar to that of a security guard surveying an area for potential risks. The guard looks for any abnormal activity or suspicious items that could be used to harm people or property. In the same way, analysts look for signs of malicious activity in computer networks and systems in order to protect them from possible attacks.	analyze	Explain analyze (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is a bit like keeping your car safe. You may have a few different ways to protect your vehicle such as locking the doors, parking in well-lit areas, and installing an alarm system. These same concepts can be used for cybersecurity by using strong passwords, changing them often, and installing antivirus software.	analyze	Explain analyze (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cyber security is a little bit like the locks on your front door. You use them to keep people out of your house who don't belong there. Cyber security works in the same way, it keeps people out of your computer who shouldn't be there.	analyze	Explain analyze (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Antispyware software is like a can of bug spray. Just as you would use bug spray to kill insects that are invading your home, antispyware software kills spyware that is invading your computer.	antispyware software	Explain antispyware software (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Antispyware software is a bit like a bouncer at a club. It's there to stop anyone who isn't supposed to be getting into your computer from doing so. It keeps track of what programs are running on your computer and stops any that it thinks might be up to no good.	antispyware software	Explain antispyware software (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Antispyware software is like a shield that protects your computer from people who are trying to spy on you. It blocks their attempts to access your computer and steal your information.	antispyware software	Explain antispyware software (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
When you go to a restaurant, the waitstaff may offer you a beverage while you are waiting for your table. This is analogous to an antispyware program providing malware protection by scanning your computer for malicious software and removing it before it can do any harm.	antispyware software	Explain antispyware software (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Antispyware software is like a security guard for your computer. It helps protect your computer from spyware and other malware that can steal your personal information or damage your computer.	antispyware software	Explain antispyware software (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Antivirus software is like a security guard for your computer. It monitors all of the activities that are happening on your computer and looks for any signs of danger. If it finds anything that looks suspicious, it will quarantine the program or file so that it can't do any damage.	antivirus software	Explain antivirus software (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Antivirus software is like a bouncer at a nightclub. It checks people (files) for bad intentions (viruses) before they are allowed into the club (your computer).	antivirus software	Explain antivirus software (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Antivirus software is like a bouncer at a nightclub. It's job is to keep out the bad guys and protect the club's patrons. Antivirus software does this by scanning your computer for signs of infection and blocking any malicious programs that it finds.	antivirus software	Explain antivirus software (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you think of your computer as a house, antivirus software is the security system that protects it from burglars. Just like a security system would sound an alarm if someone tried to break into your house, antivirus software will sound an alarm if someone tries to break into your computer.	antivirus software	Explain antivirus software (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Antivirus software is like a vaccine for your computer. It helps protect your computer from viruses, malware and other online threats.	antivirus software	Explain antivirus software (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An analogy for cybersecurity would be a bank vault. The bank vault is the asset, and the security measures (e.g., locks, alarms) are the cybersecurity. Just as it is important to have strong security measures around a physical bank vault, it is important to have strong security measures around digital assets (e.g., passwords, encryption).	asset	Explain asset (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity asset is like a lock on your door. It helps to protect your home from intruders.	asset	Explain asset (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An asset can be thought of as something of value. For example, a person's house is an asset because it has value (it can be sold for money). In the context of cybersecurity, an asset is anything that has value and could be targeted by hackers in order to gain access to that value. For example, a company's financial records are an asset because they contain valuable information about the business.	asset	Explain asset (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity asset is like a large, strong box that you can use to store your most valuable possessions. The box is sturdy and difficult to break into, so it will protect your belongings from thieves or other dangers.	asset	Explain asset (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity asset is like a fortress. It is strong, well-guarded, and can be relied on to protect your valuable information.	asset	Explain asset (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Asymmetric cryptography is similar to a locked mailbox with two keys. One key opens the mailbox and the other key can only be used to lock the mailbox again. The sender uses the locking key to encrypt the message and sends it to the receiver. The receiver uses the unlocking key to decrypt the message.	asymmetric cryptography	Explain asymmetric cryptography (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
In asymmetric cryptography, two different but mathematically related keys are used. One key is made public, while the other remains private. Messages encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key, and vice versa. This provides a high level of security, as it would be very difficult for someone to obtain access to both keys.	asymmetric cryptography	Explain asymmetric cryptography (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Asymmetric cryptography is like a locked mailbox with two keys. One key unlocks the mailbox and can be used to send messages, while the other key can only be used to open the mailbox and read the messages inside. As long as only the intended recipient has access to the reading key, the sender can be assured that their messages will not be intercepted or read by anyone else.	asymmetric cryptography	Explain asymmetric cryptography (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Asymmetric cryptography is like a safe with two different keys. One key opens the safe and one key locks the safe. The key that unlocks the safe is called the public key and the key that locks the safe is called the private key.	asymmetric cryptography	Explain asymmetric cryptography (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for asymmetric cryptography is that it is like a locked mailbox with two keys. One key (the public key) can be given to anyone who wants to send you a message, and the other key (the private key) is kept secret by you. Only you can open the mailbox using your private key, and only you can read the messages that have been sent to you using your public key.	asymmetric cryptography	Explain asymmetric cryptography (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An attack can be best likened to a home invasion. The attacker(s) seek to gain unauthorized access to your systems or data in order to exploit them for their own purposes. Just as with a physical home invasion, attackers often employ various means (e.g., social engineering, malware, brute force attacks) to achieve their goals.	attack	Explain attack (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Hackers often use a technique called “phishing” to try and steal people’s passwords. Phishing is when someone sends you an email that looks like it’s from a friend or a company you know, but the email contains a link that will take you to a website where someone can steal your password.	attack	Explain attack (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A computer virus can be thought of as a germ or other organism that spreads and causes harm to the infected host. Just like with an actual virus, a computer virus can spread quickly and cause serious damage.	attack	Explain attack (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One way to think of a cyberattack is as an attempt to break into or take over someone else's computer, smartphone, or other electronic device. Attackers may try to access your devices and information in order to steal your data, passwords, or money; spy on you; or even damage your devices or software.	attack	Explain attack (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An attack on a computer system or network is similar to an assault on a person. Just as with people, assailants try to exploit vulnerabilities in order to get what they want. They may use deception (e.g., pretending to be someone you trust) or brute force (i.e., trying many different passwords until one works) to gain access to your computer or data. Once they are in, they can damage files, steal information, and even take over your system.	attack	Explain attack (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One common analogy used to describe a cyber attack is that of a thief attempting to break into a home. Just as the thief would use various methods (e.g., smashing a window, picking a lock) to gain entry, attackers use various methods (e.g., exploiting vulnerabilities in software, spear phishing emails) to penetrate networks and systems.	attack method	Explain attack method (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The attack method can be compared to a home invasion. The attacker is attempting to gain access to the network or system through any means possible, often using malicious software or “malware” to exploit vulnerabilities in the security of the system. Once they are able to get inside, they can steal data, passwords, or even take control of the system.	attack method	Explain attack method (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Attacking a computer network is like breaking into a house. The attacker looks for weaknesses in the security — such as an open window or door — and then uses that opening to get into the network or home. Once inside, the attacker can steal information or damage systems.	attack method	Explain attack method (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Attacking a computer system can be thought of as breaking into someone's house. The attacker would find some way to get past the security measures (locks, alarms, etc.), sneak around inside, and steal or damage valuable information or equipment.	attack method	Explain attack method (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Attacking a computer system can be thought of as breaking into a building. Just as an intruder would use stealth to avoid detection and then exploit any weaknesses in the security of the building, so too do attackers try to remain undetected while they probe for vulnerabilities in a computer system and then use those vulnerabilities to gain access.	attack method	Explain attack method (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Analogy: Attack mode is like a robber entering a house. The robber can either go through the front door, which is easy but leaves evidence, or go through a window, which is harder but doesn't leave evidence.	attack mode	Explain attack mode (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Attack mode is like an animal hunting for its prey. The attacker is constantly looking for weaknesses in the system that they can exploit to gain access to information or take down the system.	attack mode	Explain attack mode (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Attack mode is the way that a hacker will try to break into a computer system. There are many different ways that this can be done, but some of the most common ones are by using malware, exploiting vulnerabilities in software or hardware, or by guessing passwords.	attack mode	Explain attack mode (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Attack mode is the way in which an attacker attempts to exploit a vulnerability. There are many different ways an attacker can launch an attack, but they all fall into one of two categories: passive or active. Passive attacks are those that don't attempt to contact the target system directly. Instead, they wait for the target to make a mistake and reveal information that can be used to mount an attack. Active attacks are those that try to contact the target system directly, often by using malicious code like malware or viruses.	attack mode	Explain attack mode (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Attack mode is similar to an animal's hunting strategy. Some animals, like lions, will patiently stalk their prey until they are in the perfect position to strike. Other animals, like cheetahs, will use speed and agility to run down their prey. In cybersecurity, attack mode refers to a hacker's approach for breaking into a system. There are three main types of attack modes: passive, active, and hybrid.	attack mode	Explain attack mode (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cyberattack is like a robber breaking into your house. The attacker (robber) tries to get past your defenses (doors and windows) to steal your data (jewelry, money, etc.).	attack path	Explain attack path (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity attack is a bit like someone trying to break into your house. They may try to use force to open a door or window, or they may try to pick the lock. Once they're inside, they can steal your stuff or damage your property.	attack path	Explain attack path (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cyberattack can be thought of as a robbery. In this analogy, the attacker is looking for an easy way into your house, perhaps by breaking a window or jimmying open a door. Once they are inside, they move from room to room stealing whatever valuables they can find.	attack path	Explain attack path (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Attacks against computer systems can be compared to burglaries. In a burglary, the burglar's goal is usually to gain access to the building and steal property from inside. Similarly, attackers try to exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems in order to take control of them or extract information from them. Just as security measures such as locks and alarm systems can deter burglars and make it more difficult for them to succeed, cybersecurity measures such as firewalls and antivirus software can help protect computer systems from attackers.	attack path	Explain attack path (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Attacking a system is like trying to break into someone's house. You start by looking for weaknesses - Maybe the door isn't locked properly, or the window is easy to open. Once you find a way in, you can start exploring the interior of the house, looking for valuable information or items to steal.	attack path	Explain attack path (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A burglar who wants to rob a house may use different techniques, such as trying to pick the lock or smashing a window. In the same way, someone who wants to hack into a computer may try different methods, such as using malware or guessing passwords.	attack pattern	Explain attack pattern (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A virus is like a cold. It's annoying and it makes you feel lousy, but eventually it goes away. A computer virus is a program that can infect your computer just like a cold can infect your body. Just like with a cold, you may not even know you have a virus until long after you've been infected.	attack pattern	Explain attack pattern (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cyberattack is like a home invasion. Just as an intruder can break into your home through a window or door, a hacker can penetrate your computer system through vulnerable entry points. Once they're in, they can steal your data, damage your systems or even take control of them.	attack pattern	Explain attack pattern (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cyberattack can be compared to a home invasion. In both cases, the perpetrator is attempting to gain access to something they are not supposed to have access to. The intruder in a home invasion is looking for valuable possessions that he can take away with him, while the hacker is looking for sensitive information that he can use or sell. Both situations can be very dangerous and should be avoided if possible.	attack pattern	Explain attack pattern (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you think about a cyberattack as being like a home invasion, then the hacker is like the thief who breaks into your house through a window or door. Once inside, the hacker can do whatever they want - steal your stuff, destroy your property, etc.	attack pattern	Explain attack pattern (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One example of an attack signature is a specific string of text that is inserted into a Web form to try and exploit a vulnerability in the application. Attackers will often use the same signature for multiple attacks in order to increase their chances of success.	attack signature	Explain attack signature (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An attack signature is like a fingerprint. It is unique to each attacker and can be used to identify them.	attack signature	Explain attack signature (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An analogy for an attack signature would be a personal identification number (PIN). Just as each person has a unique PIN, every malware program has its own unique identifying "signature." Attack signatures can be used to help identify potential attacks and thwart them before they cause damage.	attack signature	Explain attack signature (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you see a group of lions in the wild, you would know that they are there because of their distinct lion-like features. Their size, yellowish fur, and black mane are all unique to lions and can be used to identify them. In the same way, when cybercriminals leave behind traces of their activity in the form of an attack signature, it can be used to identify them and stop them from doing further damage.	attack signature	Explain attack signature (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Attack signatures are like fingerprints. They are unique to each attacker and can be used to identify them.	attack signature	Explain attack signature (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The attack surface of a computer system is made up of all the different ways an attacker could try to break into or take control of the system. It includes things like open ports on the firewall, weak passwords, and unpatched software vulnerabilities.	attack surface	Explain attack surface (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The attack surface of a company is like the door of a house. The more entrances you have, the easier it is for an intruder to get in. Similarly, the more ways there are for someone to access your computer systems or data, the easier it is for them to steal or disrupt your operations.	attack surface	Explain attack surface (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An attack surface is the sum total of all points where an unauthorized user might be able to enter or extract data from a computer system. Attackers try to identify and exploit as many vulnerabilities as they can in order to gain access to systems and data. System administrators work to reduce the size of the attack surface by patching vulnerabilities, configuring systems securely, and deploying firewalls and other security measures.	attack surface	Explain attack surface (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Attack surface is like the doors and windows of a house. The more doors and windows, the easier it is for an intruder to get in. The more features and services you have running on your computer, the more avenues there are for an attacker to exploit.	attack surface	Explain attack surface (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Attack surface is the number of potential ways an attacker could enter a system. It can be thought of as analogous to the doors and windows on a house. The more doors and windows, the easier it is for someone to get in. Similarly, the more potential entry points there are into a system, the easier it is for someone to gain access and potentially do harm.	attack surface	Explain attack surface (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Attacker (cybersecurity) is like a thief who breaks into your house to steal your belongings.	attacker	Explain attacker (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Attacker is like a burglar who breaks into your home to steal your possessions.	attacker	Explain attacker (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Attacker (cybersecurity) is like a thief who breaks into your house to steal your belongings.	attacker	Explain attacker (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Attacker is like a wasp. They are small and unassuming, but they can pack a nasty sting. Similarly, attackers can often go unnoticed until it's too late, at which point they can do significant damage.	attacker	Explain attacker (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The attacker is like a thief who breaks into your house in the middle of the night. They are looking for anything they can steal, including your most prized possessions.	attacker	Explain attacker (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for authentication is that it is like a bouncer at a club. The bouncer checks the ID of anyone who wants to enter the club to make sure they are allowed in. Authentication does something similar on a computer, by checking the identity of someone trying to access a system or network.	authenticate	Explain authenticate (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Authenticate is similar to verifying a person's identity by checking their driver's license. In cybersecurity, authenticating means verifying the legitimacy of a user, device, or application.	authenticate	Explain authenticate (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Authenticate is like when you go to the bank and they ask for your ID. They are verifying that it is really you who is trying to access your account.	authenticate	Explain authenticate (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Authenticate is like verifying a person's identity by checking their driver's license. The driver's license has identifying information such as the person's name, date of birth, and photograph. This information is compared to the information provided by the person trying to be authenticated. If they match, then the person is verified as being who they say they are.	authenticate	Explain authenticate (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
When you authenticate, you are confirming that you are who you say you are. This is similar to when you show your ID card to a security guard at a building. The guard compares the picture on the ID card with your face to confirm that they match.	authenticate	Explain authenticate (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One way to think about authentication is as a process that allows one person or thing to prove they are who they say they are. This might be done, for example, by providing a password or PIN that only the person in question knows. In the context of cybersecurity, authentication helps ensure that only authorized users can access systems and data.	authentication	Explain authentication (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you want to enter a secure building, you need to show your credentials (e.g. driver’s license or passport) to the security guard at the door. This is analogous to authentication in cybersecurity, where you need to provide proof of identification (e.g. username and password) in order to access a secure system or network.	authentication	Explain authentication (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Authentication is like a bouncer at a club. He checks your ID to make sure you are who you say you are and then allows you into the club. Authentication in cybersecurity does the same thing - it verifies that you are who you say you are and allows you access to whatever it is that you're trying to get into.	authentication	Explain authentication (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for authentication is that it is similar to a bouncer at a club. The bouncer checks the ID of each person who wants to enter the club to make sure they are allowed in. Authentication does something similar on a computer—it checks the identity of each user trying to access a system or network and makes sure they are authorized to do so.	authentication	Explain authentication (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One common analogy used to explain authentication is that of a person proving their identity by providing a driver's license. The document proves that the person presenting it is indeed who they say they are. Authentication in cybersecurity works in a similar way, by verifying the identify of an entity (usually through credentials such as a username and password) before granting them access to systems or data.	authentication	Explain authentication (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you have a bank account, you expect the money you deposit to be there when you need it. You also expect the bank to protect your account from unauthorized access by third parties. The security of your account is ensured by several factors: the physical security of the bank's building, the computer security measures used by the bank to protect its systems, and the authentication procedures used to verify your identity before allowing you access to your account.In much the same way, online activities such as banking or shopping can be secured through various authentication techniques that ensure that only authorized users are able to access them. These techniques may include passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), one-time passwords generated by tokens, or biometric identifiers such as fingerprints or retinal scans. By using these methods, companies can ensure that their customers' data is protected from unauthorized access and tampering	authenticity	Explain authenticity (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like a bank. The bank has procedures in place to ensure that only authorized individuals can access their accounts. They also have measures in place to detect and prevent fraudulent activity. Similarly, cybersecurity solutions employ measures to protect your network from unauthorized access and defend against cyberattacks.	authenticity	Explain authenticity (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
In cybersecurity, authenticity is akin to an ID card. It assures the user that the information they are seeing is real and has not been tampered with.	authenticity	Explain authenticity (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Authenticity can be thought of as the "digital fingerprint" of an email, file or other online resource. Just as each person has a unique fingerprint, each digital resource also has its own distinct pattern that can be used to verify its authenticity. By checking the digital fingerprint against a known good copy, you can ensure that the resource is genuine and has not been tampered with.	authenticity	Explain authenticity (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
When we talk about the authenticity of something, we mean that it is what it appears to be and has not been tampered with. This is similar to how a cybersecurity term might be used: We might say that a computer system is authentic if it has not been hacked or compromised by an outside party.	authenticity	Explain authenticity (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Authorization is like a security guard checking your ID at the door to a club. The security guard wants to make sure that you are allowed into the club, and that you are not carrying any weapons. Authorization is also like a bouncer at the door of a bar. The bouncer will check your ID to make sure you are over 21 years old, and then he will decide whether or not to let you into the bar.	authorization	Explain authorization (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A bank might authorize a withdrawal of $100 from an account. The account holder has been authorized to make this withdrawal by the bank. In cybersecurity, authorization is the process of verifying that a user or system is allowed to access a resource.	authorization	Explain authorization (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Authorization is like a security guard at the door of a building. The security guard checks to see if you have a valid reason to enter the building before letting you in. Authorization is also like a key that unlocks the door to a room. Only people with the right key can open the door and access the contents of the room.	authorization	Explain authorization (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One way to think of authorization is as a bouncer at a club. Before allowing someone into the club, the bouncer checks their ID to make sure they are old enough and then approves or denies them entry based on that information. In the context of cybersecurity, authorization refers to granting access to certain resources (e.g., files, networks) based on predefined criteria such as user name, password, IP address, or other attributes.	authorization	Explain authorization (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
When you go to a restaurant, the waiter will ask for your name before he brings you a menu. This is an example of authorization. The waiter is verifying that you are who you say you are before he gives you access to the menu. Authorization in cybersecurity is similar. It is the process of verifying that someone is who they say they are before giving them access to sensitive information or systems.	authorization	Explain authorization (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like having a lock on your door. It means that only people who have the key (password) can get in to your house (computer).	availability	Explain availability (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Availability is much like a library. Just as books in a library are available to anyone who wishes to read them, computer files and systems are available to authorized users when they need them.	availability	Explain availability (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Availability can be thought of as the cyber equivalent of a fire extinguisher. Just as it is important to have a fire extinguisher available in case of a fire, it is important to have cybersecurity measures in place to protect against attacks and ensure availability of systems and data.	availability	Explain availability (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Availability is similar to having a fire extinguisher in your home. If a fire starts, you want to be able to put it out quickly before it causes too much damage. In the same way, if your computer is attacked by hackers, you want to have security measures in place that will help protect your data and keep your system running smoothly.	availability	Explain availability (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Availability is like a bank. It's always open, and it never closes. However, there may be times when the bank is unable to process transactions (e.g., due to a systems outage).	availability	Explain availability (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Behavior monitoring is like keeping an eye on someone to make sure they don't do anything bad. In cybersecurity, it means keeping track of what people are doing on the internet so that we can see if anyone is trying to hack into our systems.	behavior monitoring	Explain behavior monitoring (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Behavior monitoring can be thought of as a burglar alarm for your computer. It is a tool that alerts you when someone or something is trying to access your computer in an unauthorized manner. This allows you to take action before any damage is done.	behavior monitoring	Explain behavior monitoring (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Behavior monitoring can be best explained by using an analogy. Imagine you are a security guard at a museum. You are responsible for watching the people who enter and exit the museum, as well as the exhibits inside. If someone tries to steal a painting, you would notice this behavior and report it. Behavior monitoring in cybersecurity is very similar. It involves watching the digital activity of users on your network in order to detect any suspicious or malicious behavior. This includes things like accessing confidential files or downloading malware	behavior monitoring	Explain behavior monitoring (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Behavior monitoring is like a security guard watching people as they walk in and out of a building. The security guard is looking for anything that seems suspicious, such as someone trying to sneak into the building or leave with something they shouldn't have. Behavior monitoring helps protect your computer by watching what you do online and looking for any unusual activity that could be a sign of malware or other cyber threats.	behavior monitoring	Explain behavior monitoring (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Behavior monitoring is like having a security guard watching the front door of your house to make sure no one unauthorized comes in. The security guard is looking for suspicious behavior, such as someone trying to jimmy the lock or picking the lock. If they see something strange, they will investigate and may even call the police.	behavior monitoring	Explain behavior monitoring (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A blocklist is a list of IP addresses, URLs, or email addresses that are blocked from accessing a system. This can be done for security reasons to prevent malicious users from gaining access to the system, or for other reasons such as preventing spam.	blocklist	Explain blocklist (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A blocklist is like a list of people that are not allowed to come into your house.	blocklist	Explain blocklist (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A blocklist is a list of IP addresses that are blocked from accessing a particular service. This can be done for many reasons, such as to protect the service from attack or to prevent abuse.	blocklist	Explain blocklist (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A blocklist can be thought of as a list of items that are not allowed inside a certain perimeter. For example, imagine that you are the manager of a large company and you want to keep unauthorized people from entering your building. You would create a blocklist of people who are not allowed in, and then use security measures to ensure that these people cannot get past your front door.In the same way, companies can use blocklists to prevent unauthorized users from accessing their networks or data. By adding known malicious IP addresses or email addresses to a blocklist, organizations can reduce their risk of being attacked by cybercriminals.	blocklist	Explain blocklist (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A blocklist could be thought of as a list of naughty words that are not allowed in a particular conversation. If someone tries to use one of these words, the other participants in the conversation will get a notification and can choose to block that person from continuing to talk.	blocklist	Explain blocklist (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Blue team is the name given to a cybersecurity defense strategy and its members. The blue team's role is to protect an organization's computer systems and networks from unauthorized access, theft, or damage. They do this by creating policies and procedures, identifying vulnerabilities, and responding to attacks.	blue team	Explain blue team (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Blue team is a term used in the cybersecurity and hacking communities to refer to individuals or groups who defend their systems from attack (the "red team"). The blue team's goal is typically to identify and remedy vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by the red team.	blue team	Explain blue team (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The blue team is the defensive side of a company's cybersecurity operations. They work to protect the company from attacks and vulnerabilities, while also monitoring for suspicious activities or breaches.	blue team	Explain blue team (cybersecurity) using an analogy.

Just like a password, you need to remember your cipher if you want to be able to access your information.	cipher	Explain cipher (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Ciphers are a bit like secret codes that people use to communicate with each other in a sneaky way. Suppose you and your best friend wanted to have a conversation without anyone else understanding what you're saying. You could create a secret code where each letter of the alphabet was represented by another letter. So, for example, A would be represented by Z, B would be represented by Y, C would be represented by X, and so on. This is called a cipher.

Cloud computing can be thought of as renting a room in a large, shared house. In this analogy, the cloud is the house and each individual's computer is a room. When you store something on your computer, it takes up space on your hard drive. When you store something in the cloud, it takes up space on the house's hard drive. This means that you can access your files from any computer in the house (or anywhere else with an internet connection).	cloud computing	Explain cloud computing (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cloud computing can be thought of as akin to storing things in the cloud. Just as you might store your photos on a third-party server rather than on your computer’s hard drive, you can store data, software applications, and other digital assets in the cloud. This can make them accessible from any device with an internet connection—PC, laptop, smartphone, or tablet. Cloud services can also provide extra storage space for your devices and back up your files automatically.From a cybersecurity perspective, using cloud services instead of locally storing information has both benefits and risks. The biggest benefit is that your data is less likely to be lost if something happens to your device (such as it being stolen or destroyed). Additionally, many cloud providers offer enhanced security features such as two-factor authentication and firewalls. However, there is always some risk that malicious actors could gain access to your data even if it is stored in the cloud. It’s important to choose a reputable provider with strong security measures and to keep your passwords safe and confidential.	cloud computing	Explain cloud computing (cybersecurity) using an analogy.

It then shares this information with those who need it so they can take action to protect their networks and systems.	cyber threat intelligence (cti)	Explain cyber threat intelligence (cti) (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is a fundamental component of cybersecurity and cyber defense. CTI is the practice of understanding an adversary's capabilities, intentions, and activities in cyberspace in order to inform decision-making about how to protect networks and data. The goal of CTI is to identify threats before they materialize and mitigate their impact when possible.One way to think about CTI is as "the early detection of criminal or espionage activity with the goal of neutralizing it before significant damage can be inflicted." It involves identifying malicious actors, understanding their motives and methods, tracking their movements online, and sharing this information among stakeholders so that everyone can be better prepared to defend against them.	cyber threat intelligence (cti)	Explain cyber threat intelligence (cti) (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cyber threat intelligence can be thought of as the early warning system for cyber threats. It is a process of identifying, collecting, and analyzing information on current and emerging cyber threats to better protect an organization's computer networks.

CTI is like a detective agency that specializes in tracking down cyber criminals and investigating their crimes. They gather information about the criminals and their activities, analyze it to find patterns and clues, and share it with other organizations who can use it to protect themselves from attack.	cyber threat intelligence (cti)	Explain cyber threat intelligence (cti) (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cyber Threat Intelligence can be thought of as the everyday “intelligence” that is gathered by law enforcement and intelligence agencies in order to protect a city from crime. Just as cities use data on past crimes, such as where they occurred, when they happened, and what was stolen/damaged, to inform their policing decisions; cyber security analysts use threat intelligence (information about potential cyber threats) to help defend organizations against attack. Threat intelligence includes things like the identities of attackers, the tools and techniques they have used in the past, and information on how they may try to compromise systems in the future. By using this type of information, organizations can better understand their risk profile, identify potentially malicious activity before it causes damage, and respond more effectively when attacks occur.	cyber threat intelligence (cti)	Explain cyber threat intelligence (cti) (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Data administration can be thought of as the cyber equivalent of locking your doors and windows when you leave your house. By taking simple steps to secure your data, you can make it much more difficult for criminals (or hackers) to gain access and steal your information. Just like with physical security, there is no single silver bullet that will keep your data safe 100% of the time; but by employing a variety of techniques – such as strong passwords, firewalls, and malware protection – you can dramatically reduce the risk of a breach.	data administration	Explain data administration (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Think of data administration as a fortress with walls, gates, and guards. The data administrator is the person who builds and oversees the fortress. The cybersecurity team are the guards who protect the data from intruders.	data administration	Explain data administration (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like protecting a physical office building. You would install locks on doors and windows, put up a fence around the property, and have security cameras monitoring the area. In the same way, you need to protect your data by installing firewalls, using passwords, and encrypting your information.	data administration	Explain data administration (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
To use an analogy, data administration can be thought of as the process of managing a company's physical security. This would involve things like making sure all doors and windows are locked, keeping track of who has access to which areas of the building, and installing security cameras. In the same way, data administration involves making sure that your company's data is protected from unauthorized access, keeping track of who has access to which files and databases, and implementing security measures such as firewalls and password protection.	data administration	Explain data administration (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The process of data administration (cybersecurity) can be thought of as similar to the way a bank safeguards its customers' money. Just as a bank has procedures in place to protect its customers' account information, businesses must have protocols in place to protect their proprietary data. This includes using firewalls, anti-virus software, and other security measures to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.	data administration	Explain data administration (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Data aggregation is the process of collecting data from multiple sources and compiling it into a single, unified dataset. This can be done manually, or with the help of software tools that automate the process. In cybersecurity, data aggregation is often used to improve threat detection and response capabilities by allowing analysts to more easily identify patterns and malicious activity across multiple networks and devices.	data aggregation	Explain data aggregation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One way to protect your computer from multiple attacks is to use data aggregation, which collects all the possible attack points into one place. This makes it much more difficult for an attacker to find and exploit a vulnerability in your system.An analogy would be imagining that your house is under attack by multiple assailants. Data aggregation would be like having all of these people attacking you at the same time - it would be much more difficult for any one of them to succeed.	data aggregation	Explain data aggregation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One way to think about data aggregation is as if it is a pile of logs. As more logs are added to the top, it becomes harder to see what is at the bottom. In the same way, as more data is aggregated, it becomes harder to see what is happening with individual pieces of data. This can be a problem for cybersecurity because it can make it difficult to find and fix security vulnerabilities.	data aggregation	Explain data aggregation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One way to reduce the number of bits that need to be stored or transmitted is through data aggregation. This simply means collecting related data items together and representing them as a single entity. For example, when you purchase something at a store, your transaction might be recorded by the cash register, attached to your name and credit card number. But if the store keeps track of all its customers’ transactions, it can create a much larger dataset that includes not only information about each individual purchase but also detailed information about what was purchased, when it was purchased, how much was paid for it, etc.In cybersecurity contexts, data aggregation can be used to improve security by reducing the amount of sensitive data that needs to be protected. For example, an organization might choose to aggregate login credentials (username and password) into a single record instead of storing them separately for each user account. This makes it more difficult for attackers who gain access to one username and password pair to then try to use those credentials elsewhere in the system.	data aggregation	Explain data aggregation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One way to reduce the number of records that need to be reviewed in a database is to perform data aggregation. In this process, individual data points are combined into groups, or aggregates. This can be done manually, by an administrator reviewing and combining records, or it can be done automatically by software. The advantage of data aggregation is that it makes it easier to review large amounts of data by reducing the number of individual records that need to be examined. It also makes it easier to spot patterns and correlations in the data.	data aggregation	Explain data aggregation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.

Measures that can help ensure data integrity include using strong passwords, firewalls, and anti-virus software.	data integrity	Explain data integrity (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you think of your data as a room full of valuable items, data integrity would be like making sure the door to that room is always locked. That means that no one can get into the room and steal your stuff - even if they have a copy of the key. Data integrity also ensures that the things inside the room stay in order, so you know what's where and can find what you're looking for quickly.	data integrity	Explain data integrity (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Data integrity is like having a really strong lock on your front door. It means that only people who you want to be able to enter your house can, and everyone else is kept out.

A data loss can be best explained using an analogy of a physical office building. Imagine if the office building you worked in was suddenly struck by a tornado and all the files inside were destroyed. This would be analogous to a data loss where all your important files were lost or corrupted.	data loss	Explain data loss (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Data loss is like a house fire. Everyone in the house is asleep and the fire starts in the kitchen. The smoke detectors go off, but since everyone is asleep no one hears them. The smoke spreads through the house and by the time anyone wakes up it's too late. The firefighters come, but all of the family's belongings are lost in the fire.	data loss	Explain data loss (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you lose your laptop, it's just a pain to have to replace all of the data on it. If someone steals your laptop, they now have access to all of that information - including passwords, bank account numbers, and other sensitive data.In the same way, if someone hacks into your computer system and steals your data, they can access everything from company secrets to customer credit card numbers.	data loss	Explain data loss (cybersecurity) using an analogy.

Imagine you are at a restaurant with your friends. You all want to order food, but there is only one waiter. The waiter can only serve one person at a time. If too many people try to order food at the same time, they will all have to wait for their turn. This is like a denial of service attack on a website. Too many people are trying to access the site simultaneously, so it crashes or becomes very slow.	distributed denial of service	Explain distributed denial of service (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A denial of service (DoS) attack is a type of cyberattack in which an attacker seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. The most common form of DoS attack is a traffic-based attack that floods the victim system with more requests than it can handle, so that legitimate requests cannot be serviced. A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is similar but employs multiple compromised systems to flood the target with requests, making it difficult for the target to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate traffic.	distributed denial of service	Explain distributed denial of service (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is like a group of people standing outside a store and shouting at customers to keep them from going in. Similarly, in a DDoS attack, computers are used to send huge volumes of traffic to a website or online service, overwhelming it so that genuine users can’t get through.	distributed denial of service	Explain distributed denial of service (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is like a group of people standing in the middle of a busy street, blocking everyone from getting to their destination.

A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is like a crowd of people standing in front of a store and not letting anyone else inside. DDoS attackers use compromised devices to send overwhelming amounts of traffic to the target, preventing legitimate users from accessing it.	distributed denial of service	Explain distributed denial of service (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is a bit like driving your car. You have the accelerator (the thing you push down to make the car go), and you have the brake (the thing you use to slow down or stop). The more things you add to your car, the more things there are that can go wrong. The same is true for cybersecurity. The more devices and software you add to your network, the more opportunity there is for someone to break in and cause damage.	dynamic attack surface	Explain dynamic attack surface (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for the dynamic attack surface is a castle. The walls of the castle are the perimeter defense and are designed to keep attackers out. However, as time goes on and the castle ages, parts of the wall may crumble, creating an opening that can be exploited by attackers. In addition, new features such as additional turrets or gates may be added to the castle, increasing its complexity and thus its potential vulnerability.	dynamic attack surface	Explain dynamic attack surface (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Dynamic Attack Surface is much like a constantly moving and ever-changing wall that defends an organization's digital perimeter. Just as the height, width, and composition of a physical wall can be altered to impede or stop attackers, so too can the Dynamic Attack Surface. TheDS uses real-time information about devices, users, networks, and applications to identify potential threats and automatically respond by adding more security or blocking access.	dynamic attack surface	Explain dynamic attack surface (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A company's dynamic attack surface is much like its mortgage. As the value of a home goes up, so does the interest on the mortgage. The more a company grows and innovates, the more attractive it becomes to cybercriminals who want to steal its data or shut down its systems. And just as a homeowner can take steps to reduce their mortgage interest rate - by refinancing, for example - companies can take steps to reduce their cyber risk, such as implementing better security controls or training employees in cybersecurity best practices.	dynamic attack surface	Explain dynamic attack surface (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The analogy of a dynamic attack surface is an exposed area on a ship. The more activity (such as crew moving around and loading cargo) that goes on, the more openings there are for potential attackers to exploit and potentially sink the ship. In the context of cybersecurity, this means that the more devices and applications that are connected to a network, the greater the risk for unauthorized access or malware infection.	dynamic attack surface	Explain dynamic attack surface (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Education and training in cybersecurity is a little bit like learning how to drive a car. You need to learn the basics - such as where the pedals and steering wheel are - before you can start driving. The same goes for cybersecurity: you need to learn the basics of computer security before you can start protecting your network.	education and training	Explain education and training (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity education and training can be compared to learning how to drive a car. Just as it is important for drivers to have proper instruction and practice in order to stay safe on the road, it is also important for cybersecurity professionals to have proper instruction and practice in order to protect systems and data from cyberattacks.	education and training	Explain education and training (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for cybersecurity education and training could be the way in which athletes prepare for an event. Athletes undergo rigorous training, studying the game plan, and practicing so that they are as prepared as possible when it comes time to compete.

In order to become a truly skilled cybersecurity professional, you need both formal education and practical experience.	education and training	Explain education and training (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Think of your education and training in cybersecurity as a series of building blocks. The first block is basic knowledge about computers and the internet. Next, you learn how to protect your computer from threats. After that, you learn how to identify threats and respond to them. Finally, you put all of this together in a real-world scenario by simulating a cyberattack.	education and training	Explain education and training (cybersecurity) using an analogy.

Similarly, if a hacker can easily get into your computer systems and steal your data, he or she is effectively exploiting your vulnerabilities.	exploitation analysis	Explain exploitation analysis (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Exploitation analysis is like a thief looking for the best way to break into a house. They will try different methods until they find one that works, and then they will exploit that weakness again and again.	exploitation analysis	Explain exploitation analysis (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Exploitation is like a thief breaking into a house to steal valuable possessions. The thief may use simple methods, such as picking the lock on the door, or more sophisticated techniques, such as using specialized tools to break in. Once inside, the thief will look for anything of value to take away. In the same way, exploitation by cybercriminals involves accessing and taking advantage of vulnerabilities in systems and applications in order to steal data or other assets.	exploitation analysis	Explain exploitation analysis (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
When it comes to cybersecurity, failure is basically when your computer or network gets hacked. Just like with anything else in life, there are many different ways that you can fall victim to a cyber attack. However, some of the most common reasons for failing in this area include not having enough security measures in place, not updating your software regularly and being careless with your passwords.	failure	Explain failure (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you think of cybersecurity as a fortress, then a failure in cybersecurity would be like the walls of the fortress crumbling. This could leave the inhabitants – in this analogy, the data and systems within the fortress – vulnerable to attack from outsiders.	failure	Explain failure (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
When a firewall is not properly configured, it can be like leaving your front door unlocked when you go on vacation. Anyone who knows where you live could walk right in and take whatever they want.	failure	Explain failure (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Failure in cybersecurity can be best explained by using the analogy of a home security system. A home security system is designed to protect your home from intruders, but if it is not properly installed or if there are any gaps in the coverage, the intruders will be able to get into your home undetected. In the same way, a cybersecurity system is only effective if it is properly installed and if there are no gaps in its coverage. If there are any vulnerabilities in the system, hackers will be able to penetrate your network and steal your data or damage your systems.	failure	Explain failure (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Just like when your computer freezes and you have to restart it, sometimes something goes wrong in the cybersecurity world and systems need to be rebooted. Sometimes people try to hack into a system, and other times there are technical glitches that need to be fixed.	failure	Explain failure (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A firewall is like a bouncer at a nightclub. It checks the identification of everyone who tries to enter the club and only allows authorized people in. A firewall does the same thing with computer traffic, checking each packet for information that identifies it as coming from a trusted source. If the packet doesn’t have the proper information, or if it looks like it might be from an unauthorized source, the firewall blocks it from entering your network.	firewall	Explain firewall (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A firewall is like a bouncer at a nightclub. He or she checks IDs to make sure that everyone who enters the club is of legal drinking age and has paid the cover charge. In the same way, firewalls check all packets of data that try to enter or leave your computer to make sure they are legitimate and not part of an attack.	firewall	Explain firewall (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A firewall can be best described as a protective shield that guards your computer or network from unauthorized access andprevents malicious attacks. Just like you would use a physical firewall to protect your home from intruders, you can use a software firewall to protect your computer or network from online threats.	firewall	Explain firewall (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A firewall is like a guard at the front door of a house. He checks people's IDs to make sure they are allowed into the house and if they are not, he denies them access. A firewall does the same thing with computer networks by restricting access to only those who are authorized.	firewall	Explain firewall (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A firewall can be thought of as a physical barrier that stands between two adjacent rooms in a house. This barrier is designed to keep the fire in one room from spreading to the other, and it does this by limiting the amount of oxygen that can travel between them. In the context of cybersecurity, a firewall is software or hardware that performs a similar function, blocking unauthorized access to your computer or network while allowing authorized traffic through.	firewall	Explain firewall (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Forensics is the process of using scientific methods to examine digital devices in order to find evidence for use in legal proceedings. It can be used to investigate crimes such as child pornography, online fraud, or terrorism.	forensics	Explain forensics (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Forensics (cybersecurity) can be analogized to crime scene investigation. Just as detectives examine the physical evidence at a crime scene to try and piece together what happened, cybersecurity experts look at the digital evidence left behind on computers and networks to determine who did what, when, and how.	forensics	Explain forensics (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you think of your computer as a house, forensics is like the police coming to investigate a crime that happened in your house. They want to find out what happened and who did it. Forensics helps investigators figure out what happened on a computer by looking at the evidence left behind.	forensics	Explain forensics (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you imagine that your computer is a house, forensics (cybersecurity) would be like the police investigating a crime that took place in your house. They would examine evidence such as fingerprints, DNA, and other clues to try and figure out who committed the crime. Cybersecurity professionals do the same thing with digital evidence, in order to protect computers from hackers and other online threats.	forensics	Explain forensics (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Computer forensics is the science of recovering information from computer systems (and other electronic devices) that have been damaged, destroyed, or seized as evidence. Just like regular forensics investigators use techniques to recover clues from physical crime scenes, computer forensics investigators use specialized techniques to extract data and information from digital devices.	forensics	Explain forensics (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Hackers are like burglars who break into a building to steal valuable information. They use special tools and techniques to get past security measures, and they often work in secret. Hackers can cause a lot of damage by stealing sensitive data or crashing computer systems.	hacker	Explain hacker (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A hacker is like a burglar who breaks into a house to steal things. A hacker breaks into computer systems to steal information or damage them.	hacker	Explain hacker (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A hacker is like a virus. They are someone who goes into a system and tries to find any way they can to exploit it.	hacker	Explain hacker (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A hacker is like a thief who breaks into a building to steal something. A hacker is someone who uses computer skills to break into networks or websites to steal information or cause damage.	hacker	Explain hacker (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A hacker is like a thief who can break into your house through the front door or a window. They may also be able to steal your belongings, or even physically harm you. Hackers can do the same thing online by breaking into computer systems and stealing information or causing damage.	hacker	Explain hacker (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A hash value is like a fingerprint of a file. Just as no two fingerprints are exactly alike, no two files will have the same hash value. This makes it easy to compare two files and determine whether they are copies of each other or not.	hash value	Explain hash value (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Hash value is like a fingerprint of a document. It is unique and cannot be changed without changing the hash value as well.	hash value	Explain hash value (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A hash value is a digital fingerprint of a file. Just as your fingerprints are unique to you, each hash value is unique to the file it represents. This makes them useful for identifying files, even if their names have been changed.	hash value	Explain hash value (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A hash value is like a fingerprint of a document. It is unique to that document and can be used to verify the authenticity of the document.	hash value	Explain hash value (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A hash value is like a fingerprint of a file. It is a unique number that is generated when a file is uploaded to the internet. When someone wants to download the file, the hash value can be used to verify that the file has not been changed since it was last uploaded.	hash value	Explain hash value (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Hashing is like taking a picture of your driver's license and emailing it to a friend. You can't change the picture without changing the original driver's license. When your friend receives the image, they can easily verify that it is really you by checking the photograph. Hashing works in much the same way - instead of a photograph, we use algorithms to create unique fingerprints (or hashes) of digital files. These hashes are then stored on computers or online repositories for verification purposes	hashing	Explain hashing (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Hashing is similar to putting a lock on your door. It makes it more difficult for someone to guess the combination without knowing the specific key.	hashing	Explain hashing (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Hashing is like a safety deposit box at the bank. You put your belongings in the box, and the bank gives you a key to open it. The key is unique to you and no one else has access to it. Hashing is similar because it creates a unique identifier for a file or document that can be used only by the person who created it.	hashing	Explain hashing (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Hashing is like putting a padlock on your bike. It’s a way of protecting your data so that it can only be accessed by people who have the key (the password).	hashing	Explain hashing (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Hashing is like when you use a password to unlock your phone. The hash function takes the text that you enter as a password and creates a unique string of characters from it. This new string can’t be reversed; so, even if someone gets their hands on your hashed password, they won’t be able to get into your phone without also knowing the algorithm used to create the hash.	hashing	Explain hashing (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Hazard is like a cybersecurity fire. It can burn down your house, and everything in it.	hazard	Explain hazard (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Hackers are like burglars who break into your house through a window. Once they're in, they can steal your possessions or even hurt you. Cybersecurity is like installing locks on all the windows and doors to make it harder for the burglars to get in, and also installing security cameras so you can see what's going on inside your house when you're not there.	hazard	Explain hazard (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A hazard is like a broken lock on your door. It's something that could cause harm if it's not fixed. In the context of cybersecurity, a hazard is a security vulnerability that could be exploited by hackers to gain access to your computer or data.	hazard	Explain hazard (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Hazard (cybersecurity) is like a bomb. It can cause a lot of damage if not handled correctly.	hazard	Explain hazard (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Hazard is cybersecurity term which means potential danger or risk. It can be used to describe various aspects of information security, such as software vulnerabilities, malicious code, and cyber attacks.	hazard	Explain hazard (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Ict supply chain threat (cybersecurity) is like a thief trying to break into your house. Your front door is the point of entry for the thief, and they are trying to get past your security measures (e.g. lock, alarm system) in order to gain access to your belongings. In the same way, hackers are attempting to breach your organisation's cybersecurity measures in order to steal or damage your data and systems.	ict supply chain threat	Explain ict supply chain threat (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A potential cybersecurity threat to the ict supply chain is like someone tampering with the food that is being delivered to a restaurant. They could add something harmful to the food that would make people sick, or they could simply spoil it so that no one would want to eat it. In either case, the restaurant would be in trouble because they wouldn't have any food to serve their customers. The same thing could happen with ict products if someone were to tamper with them before they reached their destination.	ict supply chain threat	Explain ict supply chain threat (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The supply chain for ict products is vulnerable to cybersecurity threats in the same way that the food supply chain is vulnerable to contamination. Hackers can break into computer systems and introduce malware or ransomware that can disable devices or steal data. They can also spoof websites or email addresses to trick users into revealing their personal information.	ict supply chain threat	Explain ict supply chain threat (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cyberattack on the supply chain of a company can be like a virus outbreak. Just as a virus can quickly spread through an organization and cause widespread damage, a cyberattack on the supply chain can compromise large amounts of data and cripple critical systems.	ict supply chain threat	Explain ict supply chain threat (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A food supply chain analogy for cybersecurity would be to think of the different parts of the food chain as different computers on a network. The farmer is the first computer, and he inputs data about his crops into a software program that tracks inventory and predicts demand. He then sends this information to the grocery store, which is the next computer in the chain. The grocery store uses this information to order products from distributors, who are like third-party suppliers. These distributors also have computers that track their inventory and send orders to manufacturers. Finally, the manufacturers have computers that produce goods based on these orders. If any part of this process is compromised by a cyberattack, it can cause disruptions in the entire supply chain.	ict supply chain threat	Explain ict supply chain threat (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Identity and access management can be thought of as the bouncer at a club. The bouncer's job is to make sure that only people who are allowed into the club are allowed in, and to keep track of who is inside the club. Identity and access management works in a similar way: it makes sure that only people who are authorized to access certain information or systems are allowed to do so, and keeps track of who has accessed what information.	identity and access management	Explain identity and access management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
IAM is like a bouncer at a club. They are in charge of verifying your identity and then letting you into the club. IAM systems work by verifying your credentials (e.g. username and password) and then granting you access to the resources that you need based on your role within the organization.	identity and access management	Explain identity and access management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Identity and access management is like a bouncer at a nightclub. The bouncer checks the ID of everyone who wants to enter the club to make sure they are allowed in. Access management is like having a list of people who are allowed into the club. Identity management is like making sure that each person has only one ID so that they can be easily identified.	identity and access management	Explain identity and access management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Identity and access management can be thought of as a set of locks on the doors to your house. Each lock has a unique key that is assigned to a specific person. Only that person can unlock the door by using their key. Identity and access management works in a similar way, except instead of locks, it uses username and password combinations. Only authorized users are able to log in by entering the correct login credentials.	identity and access management	Explain identity and access management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Identity and access management (IAM) is a field of cybersecurity that deals with the identification of users and their permission levels for accessing resources inside a computer system. IAM can be thought of as an organization's bouncer, controlling who gets in and who doesn't. IAM systems use various methods to identify people, including usernames, passwords, fingerprints, or retina scans. Once someone is identified, IAM determines what they are allowed to do. For example, an employee might be given limited access to certain files while a manager might have full access to all files. Ideally, IAM protects against unauthorized access by ensuring that only authorized users are able to get past the bouncer. However, like any security system, IAM can be bypassed if someone finds a way to circumvent it. Therefore, it is important for organizations to also deploy other security measures such as firewalls and anti-virus software in order to create a layered defense against cyberattacks	identity and access management	Explain identity and access management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for cybersecurity is the security of a building. Just as you would install a lock on your door to keep people out, you would use cybersecurity measures to keep people from accessing your computer or network without permission.	impact	Explain impact (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One common analogy used to explain the impact of a cybersecurity incident is that of a homeowners insurance policy. Imagine if your home were burglarized and all of your possessions were stolen. In addition to the physical damage done to your home, you would also be left with the emotional distress of being violated in such a way. A homeowners insurance policy would help offset some of these costs by providing financial compensation for the damage done to your home and property.In much the same way, cybersecurity incidents can cause both physical and emotional damage to organizations. Cyberattacks can steal data, destroy or corrupt files, and even take down systems or networks. In addition, victims often suffer from loss of business productivity, negative publicity, and other indirect losses.	impact	Explain impact (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like a locked door. It keeps people out who you don't want coming in, like hackers.	impact	Explain impact (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cyber breach is like someone breaking into your home. They can steal your possessions, damage your property, or even hurt you. A cyber breach can do the same thing to a business - steal information, damage equipment, or hold the company ransom.	impact	Explain impact (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If a cyberattack was like a fire, the impact would be widespread destruction. Just as a fire can easily spread from one building to another, a cyberattack can quickly infect and affect far more devices than the hacker ever intended.	impact	Explain impact (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity incident could be best described as a thief breaking into your home. The thief may steal items of value, such as jewelry or electronics, or they may vandalize your home by destroying property or causing harm to people inside. In the case of a cybersecurity incident, the thief is an unauthorized user who gains access to your computer systems and steals or destroys data.	incident	Explain incident (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If someone were to try and break into your home, they would be trying to get past your security system. Similarly, if someone is trying to hack into a computer or network, they are attempting to get around the security measures that have been put in place.	incident	Explain incident (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity incident is like someone breaking into your house. They may steal your belongings, damage your property, or even hurt you. Cybersecurity incidents can do the same thing to your computer—steal your data, damage your files, or even give hackers access to sensitive information.	incident	Explain incident (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
I was driving to work this morning and got into a car accident. A truck coming the other way ran a red light and hit my car.	incident	Explain incident (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
In the early hours of January 1, 2014, a hacker accessed the Twitter account of The Onion and tweeted that president Barack Obama had been assassinated. The tweet was removed about 20 minutes later, but not before it was retweeted more than 1,000 times.	incident	Explain incident (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
When someone spills a drink on the floor, an incident management team is called to clean it up. The team assesses the situation, determines the best way to clean it up, and then cleans it up. In cybersecurity, when an incident occurs (like a data breach), an incident management team is called in to assess the situation, determine the best way to deal with it, and then take action.	incident management	Explain incident management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for incident management is the process of dealing with a car accident. When you are in an accident, you go through a series of steps to manage the incident and keep everyone safe. You first assess the situation and make sure that it is safe to stay where you are. You then call 911 and report the accident. The emergency responders will come to help deal with the accident and keep everyone safe. They will work to clean up the scene, investigate what happened, and figure out how to best move forward. In many cases, they will also work with insurance companies to file claims and reimburse people for their losses.	incident management	Explain incident management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Incident management is similar to cleaning up a spill. In both cases, it is important to act quickly and effectively to minimize the damage. Incident management involves identifying and responding to security incidents in a timely manner. This includes assessing the impact of the incident, determining the cause, and taking steps to prevent future incidents.	incident management	Explain incident management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The process of managing and responding to incidents that occur in a network or computer system is much like the emergency response plans used by firefighters, police officers, and medical professionals. Just as these individuals have standard procedures they follow when an incident occurs, so too must those responsible for cybersecurity have a plan in place for dealing with cyberattacks and other incidents. The goal is to minimize the damage caused by the attack and restore normal operations as quickly as possible.	incident management	Explain incident management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity incident management is like traffic control. Just as traffic controllers keep vehicles moving efficiently and safely through intersections, cybersecurity analysts work to ensure that malicious activity is identified and blocked quickly, while minimizing the impact on legitimate users.	incident management	Explain incident management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An analogy for incident response in cybersecurity would be if a fire broke out in a building, the firefighters would come to put out the fire. In the same way, when there is a cybersecurity incident, responders come to help fix the issue.	incident response	Explain incident response (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity incident response is much like a fire drill. Just as you would practice evacuating your building in the event of a fire, you should also have a plan for responding to cyberattacks. This includes creating an incident response team, rehearsing your procedures, and testing your tools. By being prepared, you can minimize the damage caused by cybercriminals and help get your business back up and running as quickly as possible.	incident response	Explain incident response (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If someone breaks into your house, you would call the police. The police would then come and investigate what happened, who did it, and how to prevent it from happening again. This same process can be applied to cybersecurity incidents. When an organization experiences a cybersecurity incident, they will need to report it to their security team or IT department. The security team or IT department will then investigate what happened, who did it, and how to prevent it from happening again.	incident response	Explain incident response (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity incident response is much like a fire drill. Just as you would practice evacuating your building in the event of a real fire, you need to have a plan for how you will respond to a cyber incident. In both cases, it's important to have clear steps that everyone can follow so that everyone knows what to do and when to do it.	incident response	Explain incident response (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The analogy that I found was the best way to explain incident response is using a fire. If you have a house on fire, what do you do? You put out the fire. In order to put out the fire, you need to use water (or another extinguishing agent). To stop the spread of the fire, you need to contain it by putting up a barrier around it so it doesn’t spread. This is similar to how incident responders deal with cybersecurity incidents. They identify and stop the attack from spreading, and then they work to eradicate the threat and restore systems back to their pre-incident state.	incident response	Explain incident response (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The incident response plan is like a fire drill. It is a plan that is put into place in case of an emergency. This plan helps to ensure that everyone knows what to do if there is a cyber attack.	incident response plan	Explain incident response plan (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Your company has a fire drill plan in case of a building fire. In the event of an actual fire, everyone knows what to do and where to go. The same is true for cybersecurity. Your organization has a plan in place for responding to cyber incidents. In the event of a breach or attack, everyone will know what to do and where to go.	incident response plan	Explain incident response plan (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If your house is on fire, you would have a plan in place for what to do. You would likely have a meeting with your family beforehand and discuss which items need to be grabbed quickly if there is a fire. This same idea can be applied to cybersecurity. When a cyberattack occurs, you will want to have a plan in place for how to respond. This may involve having rehearsals so that everyone knows their role in the event of an attack.	incident response plan	Explain incident response plan (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If your home is broken into, the police will likely come to investigate. They will create a report documenting what happened and who they believe was responsible. This report can be used to help prosecute the criminals and keep them from harming anyone else in the future. In the same way, when a cybersecurity incident occurs, businesses have an established plan for responding to it. The goal is to mitigate any damage done by the attack and prevent it from happening again in the future.	incident response plan	Explain incident response plan (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The analogy I am going to use is the fire evacuation plan. When there is a fire, everyone in the building needs to know what to do. There are usually signs posted on each floor of the building with instructions telling people where to go and what they need to do when they get there. The same thing happens with cybersecurity. There is a plan in place that tells employees what they need to do when they encounter a cyber incident. This includes things like knowing which steps to take to contain the damage, who they should contact for help, and how to preserve evidence so it can be investigated.	incident response plan	Explain incident response plan (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity indicator is like a fire alarm. It's an early warning system that something bad might be happening.	indicator	Explain indicator (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity indicator is like a weather forecast. It lets you know what kind of security threats you might face, so that you can take the necessary precautions to protect your data.	indicator	Explain indicator (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An indicator is similar to a traffic light. Red means stop, yellow means caution, and green means go. An indicator in cybersecurity would be something like a warning that pops up on your computer screen telling you that someone might be trying to hack into your system.	indicator	Explain indicator (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity indicator is a light on a car dashboard. It tells the driver what system is active and how it's performing.	indicator	Explain indicator (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for indicator might be the telltale signs of a crime that have been left at the scene. Just as detectives can use these clues to piece together what happened, cybersecurity professionals use indicators to figure out if an organization has been attacked and what kind of attack it was.	indicator	Explain indicator (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An analogy for industrial control system (ICS) cybersecurity would be to think of the systems as if they are a hospital's life support systems. The hospital's ICS are critical for keeping patients alive and functioning, and just like in the real world, if these systems go down then people can die. In the same way, if an attacker were to compromise or take down an industrial control system, it could result in physical damage or loss of life.	industrial control system	Explain industrial control system (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cyber-secure industrial control system can be analogized to a fortress. Just as a fort has walls and gates to keep out unwanted visitors, a cyber-secure industrial control system has barriers that protect it from unauthorized access and attack. The walls of the fort are the perimeter security devices (e.g., fences, guards, sensors) that keep outsiders away, while the gates are the entry points where authorized personnel can gain access. Similarly, the perimeter security devices of a cyber-secure industrial control system are its firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems, which protect against unauthorized access from outside hackers. The gateways into the control system are its computer networks and applications, which must be authenticated and authorized before users can gain access.	industrial control system	Explain industrial control system (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An industrial control system can be thought of as the “brain” of a factory or other industrial facility. It monitors and controls the machinery and equipment in the plant, ensuring that everything runs smoothly. If there is an issue with one of the machines, the industrial control system will take action to correct it.Like any computer system, an industrial control system can be vulnerable to cyberattacks. Hackers could attempt to gain access to the system in order to damage or disrupt its operations. Industrial control systems are therefore often protected by security measures such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems.	industrial control system	Explain industrial control system (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An industrial control system can be thought of as the "brain" of a factory or other industrial facility. It monitors and controls all aspects of the production process, from the machines themselves to the climate in the building. Industrial control systems are increasingly being connected to the internet, which makes them vulnerable to cyberattacks.	industrial control system	Explain industrial control system (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for industrial control systems is the use of cars as an analogy for home computer networks. Just as people have to take certain precautions when driving their car (e.g., wearing a seat belt, obeying traffic laws), individuals need to take similar precautions when using their computer at home (e.g., installing anti-virus software, updating operating systems regularly). In both cases, there are risks if proper precautions are not taken. For example, someone could be injured in a car accident if they were not wearing a seat belt or they could lose data if their computer was infected with a virus.	industrial control system	Explain industrial control system (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Communication technology can be thought of as a series of tubes. Data travels down these tubes and into our homes, offices, and other places where it is used. These tubes are not always 100% secure, meaning that someone could potentially intercept the data as it travels to its destination. Cybersecurity protects these tubes from unauthorized access and ensures that the data traveling through them remains confidential.	information and communication(s) technology	Explain information and communication(s) technology (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is similar to locking your car. You use a key to lock the door, and then keep the key in your pocket. If someone tries to steal your car, they can't do it without the key. Cybersecurity is like that- you use passwords and other measures to keep people from accessing your computer or network without permission.	information and communication(s) technology	Explain information and communication(s) technology (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Information and communication technology (ICT) can be thought of as a city. Within this "city" there are buildings, streets, and alleyways. The buildings represent the various ICT systems that make up the city, such as the power grid, water system, and transportation network. The streets represent the means by which information travels between these systems, while the alleyways represent the insecure channels through which malicious actors can launch attacks against ICT systems. Just as a physical city needs to be protected from criminals and other threats, so too does ICT need to be secured against cyberattacks.	information and communication(s) technology	Explain information and communication(s) technology (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like locking your front door. You might have a deadbolt, chain, and key to make sure no one can just walk into your house. Cybersecurity is similar; you want to make sure that only authorized people can access your computer or network. You can do this by using passwords, firewalls, and anti-virus software.	information and communication(s) technology	Explain information and communication(s) technology (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An analogy for information and communication technology (cybersecurity) would be like having a strong lock on your front door. It will protect you from people who want to enter your house without permission, but it won't do anything to stop someone from coming in through a window. Similarly, cybersecurity measures can protect your computer or network from unauthorized access, but they can't prevent every possible attack.	information and communication(s) technology	Explain information and communication(s) technology (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Information assurance can be thought of as a car. The car has many different parts that need to work together in order for the car to function properly. If one part of the car is not working correctly, it can cause problems with the entire car. The same is true for cybersecurity. If one part of the network is not working correctly, it can cause problems with the entire network.	information assurance	Explain information assurance (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you think of your computer as a car, information assurance would be like making sure the driver has enough training and that the brakes are in good condition. You want to make sure that the person driving is capable of handling the car safely and that they know how to use the brakes if needed. In addition, you want to make sure that the brakes themselves are in good shape so that they will work properly if needed.	information assurance	Explain information assurance (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like having a locked door on your house. It's the first layer of security that you have to protect yourself from people who want to harm you. However, if someone has a key to your house, they can unlock the door and come inside no matter how many other locks you have. That's why it's important to also have a alarm system and/or cameras so that you can catch the person if they do get into your house. Cybersecurity is similar in that it's the first line of defense against people who want to harm your computer or steal your information. However, if someone knows how to break into your computer, they can access your information no matter how strong your cybersecurity measures are. That's why it's important to also have antivirus software and keep your operating system up-to-date so that you can catch any attempted intrusions before they happen.	information assurance	Explain information assurance (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for information assurance is that it is like locking your car. You take certain steps to make sure that your car is secure - you lock the doors, roll up the windows, and put the alarm on. If someone tries to steal your car, they will find it much more difficult if it is properly locked down. The same goes for your computer - by taking steps to secure your system, you can make it much more difficult for hackers to access your data.	information assurance	Explain information assurance (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Information assurance can be thought of as the equivalent of locking your car doors when you leave it parked on the street. You are taking a series of actions to make it more difficult for a thief to steal your property. In the same way, information assurance (cybersecurity) is a collection of measures designed to protect your computer networks and data from unauthorized access or theft.	information assurance	Explain information assurance (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for information assurance compliance (cybersecurity) is the security of a building. Just as physical security measures such as locks, alarms, and surveillance cameras are used to protect people and property inside a building, cybersecurity measures such as firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems are used to protect data and systems from unauthorized access or attack.	information assurance compliance	Explain information assurance compliance (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for information assurance compliance is to imagine that your computer is a car. The firewall is like the metal frame of the car, keeping you safe from harm. Anti-virus software is like the airbags, keeping you safe in case of an accident. User authentication is like seat belts, keeping you in your seat if there's a collision. And data encryption is like the driver's side airbag, protecting you from injuries caused by flying debris.	information assurance compliance	Explain information assurance compliance (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Information assurance compliance can be thought of as a form of cyber security. Just like you would use locks and other security measures to protect your home from physical theft, you need similar measures to protect your online information. This includes using strong passwords, installing anti-virus software, and being careful about what websites you visit and what links you click on.	information assurance compliance	Explain information assurance compliance (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like a lock on your door. It assures that only authorized individuals can enter your home, and it keeps unwanted people out.	information assurance compliance	Explain information assurance compliance (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Information assurance compliance can be thought of as resembling the security measures one takes to protect their home. Just as you might install a security system, deadbolt, and chain lock on your front door, you would take similar precautions to secure your computer networks and data. These might include installing firewalls, antivirus software, and spam filters.	information assurance compliance	Explain information assurance compliance (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Information security policy can be thought of as a set of rules that dictate how people should interact with information. Just as you would not want someone to walk into your house and take whatever they want, you do not want someone to access your confidential information without permission. The rules that make up information security policy help to protect your confidential data from unauthorized access.	information security policy	Explain information security policy (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Information security policy can be thought of as a set of rules that dictate how people should behave when using the internet. just like there are speed limits on the highway, information security policy dictates how fast people can browse the web, what types of files they can download, and what type of information is considered confidential.	information security policy	Explain information security policy (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity policy can be thought of as a set of rules that your family abides by when they are online. The rules might include things like never sharing your passwords with anyone, always using strong passwords, and not opening emails from people you don’t know. These same rules would apply to your business when it comes to its cybersecurity policy. Some specific rules businesses might have include never opening an email attachment from someone you don’t know, always updating your software, and using encryption for sensitive data.	information security policy	Explain information security policy (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An information security policy is much like a speed limit sign on the side of a road. It tells drivers how fast they are allowed to go, and reminds them of the consequences for breaking the law. Similarly, an information security policy sets rules for how employees can use company data, and warns them of the consequences for violating these rules.	information security policy	Explain information security policy (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The information security policy can be analogized to traffic laws. Just as drivers must obey speed limits, stop signs, and other traffic laws in order to ensure the safety of everyone on the road, computer users must obey information security policies in order to protect the data of the organization. These policies help ensure that all employees are using best practices when it comes to protecting company data, which can help minimize the risk of a cyberattack.	information security policy	Explain information security policy (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Information sharing is like a neighborhood watch. If you see something suspicious, you tell your neighbors so they can be on the lookout, too. In cybersecurity, information sharing means telling other companies about any threats or attacks that you've seen so they can protect themselves from them.	information sharing	Explain information sharing (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for information sharing is that of a neighborhood watch. In this analogy, the homeowners in the neighborhood share information about suspicious activity they have seen (such as people walking around late at night), so that everyone can be on alert and potentially prevent a crime from happening. In the context of cybersecurity, businesses and organizations share information about cyber threats (such as malware) so that everyone can be on alert and potentially prevent an attack from happening.	information sharing	Explain information sharing (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Information sharing between two entities is similar to a football game. In order for each player on the field to be successful, they must communicate with one another and share information. Likewise, in order for businesses to protect their networks and data, they need to regularly share information about threats and vulnerabilities with each other. By doing this, they can build a stronger defense against cyber attacks and improve their overall cybersecurity posture.	information sharing	Explain information sharing (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
When you share a file with someone, you are sending them a copy of the file. When you share information (cybersecurity), you are sending the person or people the information that is needed to complete the task.	information sharing	Explain information sharing (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like a locked room with one key. Only people who have the key can enter the room. The key represents information that is shared between trusted individuals in order to protect the contents of the room.	information sharing	Explain information sharing (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
When it comes to cybersecurity, think about your computer like a city. If you have one firewall and someone decides to attack your computer (or city), the firewall is the only thing standing in between your computer/city and total destruction. However, if you have multiple firewalls, the attacker would need to get through all of them in order to do any damage - which is much more difficult. This is basically what information system resilience (cybersecurity) is - having multiple layers of protection in place so that if one layer fails, another will still be there to protect your data.	information system resilience	Explain information system resilience (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
In information system resilience (cybersecurity), just as when a building is hit by an earthquake, the goal is to have enough backup systems in place so that the essential functions of the organization can continue despite the damage. In order for this analogy to hold up, though, we would also need to assume that there are different parts of the organization that are critical (just like different buildings in an urban area), and that these different parts can be supported by multiple backup systems (just like multiple bridges might span a river).	information system resilience	Explain information system resilience (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Your home is your information system. The walls, doors, and windows are your security controls. Your alarm system is your cybersecurity solution. If someone tries to break into your home, the alarm will sound and the police will be notified. Your information system is resilient if it can withstand an attack and continue to function normally.	information system resilience	Explain information system resilience (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cyber-resilient information system is akin to a boxer who continues to fight after taking several hard punches. The boxer may be bruised and battered, but he or she will continue to fight until the final bell rings. A cyber-resilient information system is able to withstand an attack and still function properly.	information system resilience	Explain information system resilience (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Information system resilience can be thought of as the ability of an organization to continue to operate in the face of cyberattacks. Just as a city must have robust infrastructure in order to withstand natural disasters, an organization's information systems must also be resilient in order to survive cyberattacks. This means that the organization must have multiple layers of protection in place, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and anti-virus software. It also means that employees must be aware of basic cyber hygiene practices, such as never clicking on suspicious links or downloading unknown files.	information system resilience	Explain information system resilience (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like a fortress with walls, gates, and guards. The walls are the perimeter of the network and are meant to keep unauthorized users out. The gates are the means of access into the network and must be guarded carefully. The guards are the security measures that protect the data inside the network.	information systems security operations	Explain information systems security operations (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
There are many different ways to describe cybersecurity operations, but one way to think about it is as an onion. There are multiple layers of security, and each layer is designed to protect the layer below it. The outermost layers are the ones that most people see and interact with—the website they visit, the email they send, etc.—and these layers are typically protected by a firewall. The inner layers contain more sensitive information, such as user passwords and credit card numbers, and these layers are typically protected by encryption.	information systems security operations	Explain information systems security operations (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for information systems security operations is that it is like a house alarm. The alarm system is in place to detect when someone tries to enter the home without permission and then sound an alarm to notify the homeowner and scare off the intruder. Information systems security operations are in place to detect when someone tries to access or damage protected data, networks, or devices and then take action to prevent unauthorized access or damage.	information systems security operations	Explain information systems security operations (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The cyber security operations of a company can be thought of as being like the police force of that company. Just as the police are responsible for protecting the people and property of that city, the cyber security team is responsible for protecting the data and systems of their company. The cyber security team's goal is to prevent attacks from happening, and to respond quickly if an attack does occur.	information systems security operations	Explain information systems security operations (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Information systems security operations can be described as a cyber-defense operation. Just as you would deploy physical security measures to protect your home or office, you need to deploy cybersecurity measures to protect your computer networks and data. Cybersecurity is all about creating defenses against potential attacks, which can come from hackers, malware, or even disgruntled employees.Some of the most common cybersecurity measures include firewalls, antivirus software, and password protection. You also need to have a plan in place for dealing with emergencies, such as hacker attacks or data breaches. By following these basic steps, you can help protect your organization from cybercrime and keep your confidential information safe and secure.	information systems security operations	Explain information systems security operations (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Information technology (cybersecurity) can be thought of as a series of locks on your doors and windows. You may have a strong lock on your door, but if the window is left open, someone could easily enter your home. Similarly, you may have a strong cybersecurity protocol in place, but if one of your employees clicks on a phishing link, they could easily allow malware into your system.	information technology	Explain information technology (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity can be thought of as a lock on your door. The lock is there to keep people out of your house, and the cybersecurity measures are in place to protect your computer from unauthorized access.	information technology	Explain information technology (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like a lock on your front door. You use it to keep people out of your house who you don't want in there. Cybersecurity is also like a shield that protects you from people trying to attack your computer system.	information technology	Explain information technology (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like locking your door when you leave your house. You are taking measures to make sure that no one can come into your house without permission and steal or damage your belongings. Cybersecurity is the same thing, but for digital devices and information instead of physical objects. You are taking measures to make sure that no one can come into your device or information without permission and steal or damage your data.	information technology	Explain information technology (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like a wall around a city. The wall protects the city from people who want to harm the citizens. The cybersecurity measures keep the bad guys out and protect the data of the citizens inside.	information technology	Explain information technology (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Inside threat is like someone breaking into your house through a window. They may steal your belongings, damage your property, or even hurt you. A cybersecurity breach is similar- someone accessing your computer without authorization and stealing or damaging your information.	inside( r) threat	Explain inside( r) threat (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Inside threats, such as malicious insiders or hacked employees, can be difficult to detect and prevent because they already have authorized access to your systems and data. They may use their knowledge of your organization's vulnerabilities to steal information, disrupt operations, or worse.	inside( r) threat	Explain inside( r) threat (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Inside threats are cyberattacks that originate from within an organization's network. For example, a hacker might gain access to the company's computer systems and then steal or delete data. Another common type of inside threat is a malicious employee who intentionally damages the company's computer systems or steals information for financial gain.	inside( r) threat	Explain inside( r) threat (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Inside threat (cybersecurity) is like someone breaking into your house through a window. They are already inside and have easy access to all of your belongings.	inside( r) threat	Explain inside( r) threat (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Inside threats are risks that come from people who already have access to an organization's networks and systems. These risks can include malicious insiders with intent to harm the organization, or accidental insiders who may inadvertently cause damage.	inside( r) threat	Explain inside( r) threat (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Integrated risk management (cybersecurity) is like a car. The car has many different parts that need to work together in order for the car to run properly. If one of the parts fails, it can cause problems with the entire car. Cybersecurity is similar because organizations have many different components that need to work together in order for the organization to be protected from cyberattacks. If one of these components fails, it can leave the organization vulnerable to a cyberattack.	integrated risk management	Explain integrated risk management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like insurance. It's a way to protect yourself against potential losses by implementing procedures and controls that reduce your overall risk. By definition, risks can never be eliminated completely, but they can be managed in a way that makes them more manageable and less costly.	integrated risk management	Explain integrated risk management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity can be thought of as a house with many different rooms. The most important room is the one where the family lives - this is the main part of the house and represents your computer, data, and networks. Other rooms in the house include your financial assets (the attic), your personal information (the bedrooms), and your utilities (the basement). If someone breaks into any of these other parts of the house, they can steal or damage your belongings. Similarly, if someone breaks into your computer, they can steal or damage your data or even take over control of your network.Just like you would use locks on all the doors and windows to protect your family from intruders, you need to use cybersecurity measures to protect your computer and networks from attackers. These measures might include firewalls, anti-virus software, passwords, and encryption. By using these tools effectively, you can reduce the risk that an attacker will be able to break into your systems and cause harm.	integrated risk management	Explain integrated risk management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Integrated risk management can be thought of as a "cybersecurity" analogy using the food industry. Just as a business needs to have multiple systems in place to protect their food (e.g., refrigeration, handling, cooking), they also need multiple systems in place to protect their data (e.g., firewalls, virus protection, user authentication). By protecting all aspects of their operation, businesses can minimize the risk of any one area being compromised and affecting the entire organization.	integrated risk management	Explain integrated risk management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Integrated risk management is like building a house. The first step is to identify what you are trying to protect (the asset), then put up a fence around it (cybersecurity). Next, you need to make sure the inside of the house is protected by installing locks on doors and windows (information security) and adding smoke detectors and fire extinguishers (business continuity/disaster recovery). Finally, you need to have a plan in case something does happen, such as a fire or burglary (incident response).	integrated risk management	Explain integrated risk management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Integrity is like a strong wall that surrounds your house. It helps to keep out bad guys and protect your family.	integrity	Explain integrity (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Integrity is like a lock on a door. It ensures that the data (or information) is only accessed by those who are supposed to have access, and prevents unauthorized changes from being made.	integrity	Explain integrity (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Integrity is like your virginity. It can only be given away once, and it's important to keep it protected.	integrity	Explain integrity (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Integrity can be described as the trustworthiness of a system or its data. When it comes to cybersecurity, integrity is key – you need to know that the data you’re relying on is accurate and hasn’t been tampered with. You can think of integrity in terms of a bank – if someone manages to hack into the bank’s systems and change your account balance, that would be a major breach of integrity.	integrity	Explain integrity (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Integrity is like a shield that protects your computer from bad things that could happen, like viruses or hackers. It keeps your computer safe by making sure that the files on it are not changed without your permission.	integrity	Explain integrity (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
When you lock your car, you are doing so to protect your belongings. The intent of cyber security is similar: to protect your computer networks and information from unauthorized access or theft.	intent	Explain intent (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Intent is like a thief who wants to rob a store. The thief's intent is to get into the store and take whatever they can. Similarly, in cybersecurity, an attacker's intent is to breach your systems and steal data or sensitive information.	intent	Explain intent (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Intent is similar to the intent of a criminal when they rob a store. The criminal has a plan and knows what they are doing. They have an intent to commit the crime and get away with it. In cybersecurity, we want to know the intent of someone who is trying to break into our systems. We want to know what their plan is and stop them before they can cause any damage.	intent	Explain intent (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The intent of cybersecurity is to protect a computer network from unauthorized access and exploitation. This can be compared to locking your front door to keep out thieves.	intent	Explain intent (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The intent of cybersecurity is to protect a computer system from unauthorized access or use. This can be compared to locking your doors at night to keep thieves out of your house.	intent	Explain intent (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Interoperability (cybersecurity) can be analogized to a set of railroad tracks. Just as two trains cannot occupy the same space on the tracks at the same time, two different cybersecurity systems cannot operate on the same network simultaneously without conflict. To achieve interoperability (cybersecurity), then, each system must have a way to communicate with the other so that they can avoid conflicts.	interoperability	Explain interoperability (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you have two different computers, they can't share information directly with each other. You need an intermediary device to bridge the gap and allow them to communicate. In cybersecurity, interoperability is the ability for different systems to work together seamlessly. This allows organizations to share data and insights more easily, which enhances security overall.	interoperability	Explain interoperability (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Interoperability is like a group of people trying to work together to solve a problem. If everyone can speak the same language and share information easily, then they will be able to work more effectively as a team. If there are communication barriers or misunderstandings, it will be much harder for them to achieve their goal. The same principle applies in cybersecurity: if different systems can communicate easily and share information securely, then the overall security of the network will be stronger. However, if there are communication problems or incompatible systems, it will leave the network vulnerable to attack.	interoperability	Explain interoperability (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Interoperability is like a group of people speaking different languages trying to have a conversation. Each person can only understand their own language, so they need to use a common translator to communicate with each other. In the context of cybersecurity, this analogy illustrates how different technologies (e.g., devices, programs, platforms) need to be able to work together in order for them to effectively protect an organization's networks and data.	interoperability	Explain interoperability (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Interoperability is the ability of two or more systems to work together. In cybersecurity, this means that different computer systems can share information and communicate with each other securely. This allows businesses and organizations to collaborate more efficiently and makes it easier for them to protect their networks from attacks.	interoperability	Explain interoperability (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Think of a cyber intrusion as if it was an unwelcome guest in your house. This guest has come into your home without permission and is snooping around, looking through your personal belongings and going through your files. This guest is also attempting to access your devices and information in order to exploit them for their own benefit.	intrusion	Explain intrusion (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Intrusion is like a thief breaking into your house. They steal your possessions and leave you feeling violated.	intrusion	Explain intrusion (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy to describe intrusion is that it is like someone breaking into your house. They may enter through an unlocked door or window, or they may force their way in. Once inside, they can steal your belongings or damage your property. In the world of cybersecurity, an intruder is someone who gains unauthorized access to a computer system or network. They can then steal information, delete files, or install malware on the system.	intrusion	Explain intrusion (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
In intrusion (cybersecurity), attackers use malicious code or techniques to gain access to a computer system or network. This can allow them to steal data, install ransomware, or take control of the system. Intrusion is often compared to breaking into a physical building, as the attacker is trying to gain access to something that is not supposed to be accessible.	intrusion	Explain intrusion (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Intrusion is like someone breaking into your house while you are away. They steal your things, damage your property, and leave you with a mess to clean up.	intrusion	Explain intrusion (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Intrusion detection is like a security guard at a gate. The security guard checks to see if everyone has a badge and only allows people in who have one. Intrusion detection software does the same thing for your computer. It checks all the data coming in and out of your computer to make sure it is safe.	intrusion detection	Explain intrusion detection (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Intrusion detection is like a security guard at your house. The security guard patrols the property and looks for anything that seems out of place or suspicious. If they see something, they investigate to find out what is going on. Intrusion detection systems do the same thing in cyberspace. They patrol networks and look for any signs of unauthorized activity. If they see something, they investigate to find out what is happening.	intrusion detection	Explain intrusion detection (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Intrusion detection is similar to a smoke detector. A smoke detector senses when there is an increase in heat and then signals the fire department. An intrusion detection system (IDS) does the same thing for cybersecurity. It detects when there is an increase in activity on the network and then signals the IT department.	intrusion detection	Explain intrusion detection (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Intrusion detection is like a security guard at a building. The security guard watches the people coming into the building and looks for anything that seems suspicious. If the security guard sees something that seems wrong, he will investigate and try to figure out what is going on. Intrusion detection works in the same way. It watches all of the traffic coming into your computer system and looks for any activities that seem suspicious. If it finds something, it will investigate and try to figure out what is going on.	intrusion detection	Explain intrusion detection (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you have a security system in your home, it's an intrusion detection system. It monitors for any activity that is not authorized and sounds an alarm when it detects something. Intrusion detection systems in cybersecurity work the same way. They monitor networks and systems for unauthorized activity and sound an alarm when they detect something.	intrusion detection	Explain intrusion detection (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
When a computer is infected with a virus, the user may investigate the source of the virus in order to find a solution. In much the same way, cybersecurity professionals use various tools and techniques to investigate cyber attacks in order to find solutions and prevent future attacks.	investigate	Explain investigate (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Investigating cybersecurity is a bit like investigating a crime. Investigators need to gather information and evidence, and then analyze it to try to figure out what happened. They also need to come up with ways to prevent future crimes from happening.	investigate	Explain investigate (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like locking your front door. It's a way to protect yourself from people who might want to harm you.	investigate	Explain investigate (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
When you investigate a crime, you are looking for clues to try and identify the perpetrator. When it comes to cybersecurity, investigators are doing the same thing – looking for clues that will help them understand how an attack was carried out, and who was responsible.	investigate	Explain investigate (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
To investigate cybersecurity is to look for vulnerabilities and possible attack points in a computer system or network. This can be done manually by examining the system closely, or through automated scanning tools that search for known weaknesses. Once these are found, they can be fixed before an attacker can exploit them.	investigate	Explain investigate (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If a crime has been committed, the police department will launch an investigation. They will collect evidence and try to identify the culprit. In the case of a cybersecurity incident, companies will do much of the same thing. They will collect evidence and try to identify the source of the attack.	investigation	Explain investigation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The investigation process can be thought of as a cyber version of a crime scene. Just as detectives and forensics teams collect evidence at a crime scene in order to piece together what happened, cybersecurity professionals do the same thing with digital data. They use forensic techniques to examine digital devices and networks for signs of intrusion or attack, and then they work to identify the perpetrators and figure out how they were able to penetrate the system.	investigation	Explain investigation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you think of your computer as a house, the firewall is like a security guard posted at the front door. The firewall is constantly watching all traffic going in and out of your computer, and it blocks any unauthorized attempts to access your files or data. If someone tries to hack into your computer, the firewall will stop them before they can do any damage.	investigation	Explain investigation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
When you investigate a crime, you are looking for clues to help you find the perpetrator. You may go through witness statements, physical evidence, and forensic evidence in order to piece together what happened. In cybersecurity, we do the same thing. We look for clues in digital traffic and data that can tell us how an attack happened and who was responsible.	investigation	Explain investigation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you think of a cyber investigation as being like a detective investigating a crime, then the first step would be to gather information about what happened. This might include looking at logs that show what programs were running on the system at the time of the attack, as well as gathering any evidence that was left behind (like malware or hacked files). The next step would be to try and identify who was responsible for the attack. This might involve looking for clues like IP addresses or hacker tools that can be traced back to specific individuals or groups. Finally, once you have determined who is responsible for the attack, you need to come up with a plan to protect your systems from future attacks.	investigation	Explain investigation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like a fence around your house. It's there to protect you from people who might want to do harm to you or your property.	it asset	Explain it asset (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity asset is like a safe. It protects your valuable items (information) from being stolen or damaged.	it asset	Explain it asset (cybersecurity) using an analogy.

Cybersecurity is like a fence around your house. It keeps people out who you don't want inside and it also keeps burglars from stealing your stuff.	it asset	Explain it asset (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Think of a firewall as a bouncer at the door of a club. The firewall is there to keep out anyone who doesn't have permission to enter the network. It also monitors traffic going in and out of the network, looking for anything that might be harmful.	it asset	Explain it asset (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Walking into a room with a loaded gun without knowing who or what is in the room would be like logging onto your computer without any protection. You are walking blindly into possible danger and you may not even know it. However, if you have a security system (firewall) in place, then you can protect yourself from unknown dangers lurking in the digital world.	key	Explain key (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for cybersecurity is that it is like locking your car. You take measures to ensure that your car is locked when you are not using it, and you also have a system in place to prevent someone from breaking into your car if it is parked on the street. In the same way, you can take measures to protect your computer or other digital devices from being hacked, and you can also put in place systems to detect any attempted hacks and respond quickly.	key	Explain key (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A key is a small metal object that is used to unlock or open a door. In the same way, cybersecurity is a term used to describe the various measures taken to protect electronic devices and digital information from unauthorized access or theft.	key	Explain key (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
In the early days of cars, drivers had to use hand signals to communicate with other drivers. This was effective, but it was also dangerous because it required people to be out in the open and vulnerable to traffic accidents. With the advent of the car horn, drivers could communicate with each other from inside their vehicles, making road travel much safer.Similarly, cybersecurity is all about communication between computers. In an ideal world, we would be able to trust every computer we interacted with and never have to worry about them being compromised. But this is not an ideal world, and there are many ways for hackers to gain access to our systems. A key part of cybersecurity is developing tools and techniques that allow us to safely communicate with others online despite these risks.	key	Explain key (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you think of your computer as a house, the key is the security system that protects your house from being entered by people who don't have permission. The key might be a physical key that opens your door or it might be a password that you enter on your computer to log in. Either way, the key is what keeps unauthorized people out.	key	Explain key (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A key pair is like a set of two keys that are used to unlock a door. One key is for the lock on the inside of the door and one key is for the lock on the outside of the door.	key pair	Explain key pair (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A key pair is a set of two cryptographic keys, one public and one private. The public key can be shared with anyone, while the private key must be kept secret. The two keys are used to encrypt and decrypt data.	key pair	Explain key pair (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A key pair is like a set of keys to your house. The public key is like the key you give to people so they can unlock your door from the outside, and the private key is like the key you keep hidden in your pocket that unlocks the door for you.	key pair	Explain key pair (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A key pair is like a password and login combo. The password is the private key, and the login is the public key. Together they create a secure way for you to access your account (cybersecurity).	key pair	Explain key pair (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A key pair is like a set of keys for your house. The public key is like the key you give to people so they can unlock your door, and the private key is like the key you keep in your pocket to actually unlock the door.	key pair	Explain key pair (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like creating a strong fence around your house. You want to make sure that you have locked all of the doors and windows, and that there is no way for someone to get into your house without you knowing about it. The same goes for your computer - you want to make sure that there are no holes in your security system that someone could use to steal your information or damage your computer.	key resource	Explain key resource (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like a lock on your front door. It's there to keep people from getting into your house without permission.	key resource	Explain key resource (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A key resource in cybersecurity is like a lock on a door. It protects the contents of the room (the data) from unauthorized access. The key (cybersecurity) is necessary to open the lock and get into the room.	key resource	Explain key resource (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like a lock on your front door. It protects your home from people who may want to enter without your permission.	key resource	Explain key resource (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A key resource in cybersecurity is similar to a key to a safe. It is something that is needed in order to access and protect information. In the case of cybersecurity, the key would be a password or other form of authentication that is required in order to access protected systems or data.	key resource	Explain key resource (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A keylogger is a computer security program that tracks and records all the keystrokes on a user's keyboard. This information can then be accessed by the person who installed the keylogger software. Keyloggers can be used for malicious purposes, such as stealing passwords or credit card numbers, or they can be used legitimately, for example to track employee productivity.	keylogger	Explain keylogger (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A keylogger is a tool that records each keystroke made on a computer keyboard. This information can then be used to spy on someone's online activities, or to steal their passwords and other sensitive data.	keylogger	Explain keylogger (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A keylogger is a type of spyware that can be installed on a computer to track and record all keystrokes made by the user. This information can then be accessed by the person who installed the keylogger, or anyone else who has access to it. Keyloggers can be used for a variety of purposes, such as monitoring employee activity, tracking online activities, or stealing passwords and other sensitive information.	keylogger	Explain keylogger (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Keyloggers are similar to bugs in that they can be used to track and monitor everything you do on your computer. Keyloggers are malicious software programs that install themselves on a computer without the user's knowledge. Once installed, keyloggers record every keystroke made on the keyboard, as well as the time and date of each keystroke. They can then send this information back to the person who installed the keylogger, allowing them to see everything you typed, including passwords, emails, and chat messages.	keylogger	Explain keylogger (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A keylogger is a cyber security tool that records all the keystrokes typed on a keyboard. It can be used to capture usernames, passwords, and other personal information. It works by installing itself on a computer as a software program or by plugging into the USB port.	keylogger	Explain keylogger (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Knowledge management can be analogized to a castle with a moat. The knowledge in the castle is analogous to the valuable data within an organization, and the moat represents the cybersecurity measures that protect it. Just as medieval castles were protected by high walls and ditches filled with water, today’s organizations rely on firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other security technologies to keep their data safe from unauthorized access.	knowledge management	Explain knowledge management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
You can think of knowledge management (cybersecurity) as a library. The library has books on many different subjects, and it is the responsibility of the librarian to make sure that everyone who wants a book can find one, and that no one takes too many books home at once. The librarian also needs to keep track of which books have been borrowed and when they are due back.The same is true for knowledge management (cybersecurity). We need to make sure that everyone who needs access to our cybersecurity resources can find them, and that no one takes too many resources at once. We also need to keep track of which resources have been used and when they are due back.	knowledge management	Explain knowledge management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Knowledge management can be thought of as a library for cybersecurity. Just as a library organizes and stores books for easy access, knowledge management systems store information on threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices in one place so that analysts can quickly find the data they need to protect their networks.	knowledge management	Explain knowledge management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A knowledge management (cybersecurity) system can be thought of as a library. The library has books on many different subjects. The books are organized in a way that makes them easy to find. The library also has staff who are knowledgeable about the books and can help you find what you need.	knowledge management	Explain knowledge management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Imagine you are a homeowner. You have a gate at the front of your house to keep people out, and you also have a lock on your door to keep people in. The lock on your door is what keeps your house secure. Now imagine that someone creates a key that can open your door without having to use the lock. That would be like someone getting into your computer without needing to know your password. Cybersecurity is all about making sure that people can't get into your computer or network without having the correct permissions or passwords.	knowledge management	Explain knowledge management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A lawyer is someone who can help you understand the law and advocate for your rights. They can also provide legal advice, which is a recommendation about what you should do in a specific situation.	legal advice and advocacy	Explain legal advice and advocacy (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
In the legal world, just as in the cybersecurity world, there are different types of attorneys. There are those who give general legal advice – similar to security consultants who offer broad-based consulting services; there are litigators who represent clients in court proceedings and argue on their behalf – similar to ethical hackers who use penetration testing techniques to expose vulnerabilities in systems so they can be fixed; and finally there are transactional lawyers who work with clients to negotiate and draft contracts or agreements – similar to system administrators responsible for implementing security measures and ensuring compliance with regulations. In order for an individual or organization to receive the best possible legal representation, it is important that they find an attorney whose practice areas align with their specific needs. The same is true for cyber security. Organizations need to identify the specific threats they face and then seek out experts who can help them mitigate those risks.	legal advice and advocacy	Explain legal advice and advocacy (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you have a legal question, you might go to a lawyer. The lawyer will listen to your question, ask you some questions, and then give you some advice. This is similar to what cybersecurity professionals do when they are asked for help. First, they listen to the problem and figure out what needs to be done. Then they provide advice on how best to fix the issue. Finally, they advocate for their solution so that it can be implemented properly.	legal advice and advocacy	Explain legal advice and advocacy (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you are ever in a car accident, you may be tempted to apologize to the other driver and offer to pay for any damage. This is an example of legal advice, which is giving someone guidance on how they should behave given their situation. In this analogy, legal advocacy would be like being your own personal lawyer and arguing on your behalf.	legal advice and advocacy	Explain legal advice and advocacy (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Legal advice and advocacy (cybersecurity) can be thought of as a fire alarm. The legal adviser or advocate is the person who sounds the alarm and helps to get people out of danger. They provide information and support, making sure that everyone understands their rights and options.	legal advice and advocacy	Explain legal advice and advocacy (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Machine learning is the process of exposing a computer system to large amounts of data, allowing it to learn how to recognize patterns and make predictions on its own. Evolutionary algorithms are a type of machine learning that use principles of natural selection to improve the performance of computer systems over time. In cybersecurity, machine learning can be used to identify malicious activity by analyzing past behavior patterns. Evolutionary algorithms can be used to create more sophisticated malware detection systems by incorporating feedback from previous detections.	machine learning and evolution	Explain machine learning and evolution (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Machine learning is like a cat. It starts off as a small, cute kitten and then it grows into a big, ferocious tiger. The more data you give it, the better it gets at doing its job. Evolution is also like a cat. It starts off with one or two small animals and over time, those animals evolve into bigger and stronger creatures. The more data you give it, the better it gets at adapting to its environment.	machine learning and evolution	Explain machine learning and evolution (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
In machine learning, a computer system is given data that it can learn from. The system then "learns" how to identify patterns in the data and make predictions based on those patterns. In evolution (cybersecurity), computers are constantly being exposed to new viruses, malware, and other threats. Over time, they develop new methods of identifying and defending against these threats.	machine learning and evolution	Explain machine learning and evolution (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Machine learning can be thought of as a process of evolving defenses. Just as life on earth evolves in response to threats (predators, climate change, etc.), so too does cybersecurity. Machine learning uses artificial intelligence algorithms to study past data and then make predictions about new or unknown threats. This allows businesses to automatically update their defenses in real-time, without having human experts examine every possible threat.	machine learning and evolution	Explain machine learning and evolution (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
In cybersecurity, machine learning is the process of using artificial intelligence (AI) to teach computers how to identify and respond to specific threats. This can be done by feeding the computer massive amounts of data about past attacks, including what worked and what didn’t. The computer then uses this information to create models that can help it detect new or unknown threats in real time. Evolution, on the other hand, is a natural process that allows organisms to adapt and survive in changing environments. In cybersecurity, evolution refers to the way malware evolves over time in order to evade detection and security measures.	machine learning and evolution	Explain machine learning and evolution (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A macro virus is a type of computer virus that is written in a programming language that can be used to create macros. Macros are small programs that can be executed by a word processor or other software application. Macro viruses are designed to spread from one document to another and they can also infect system files.	macro virus	Explain macro virus (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A macro virus is a type of computer virus that can infect documents and spread through email. It is a small program that is hidden inside a larger document or application. When the document or application is opened, the virus will run and may do damage to your computer.	macro virus	Explain macro virus (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A macro virus is a computer virus that is written in a programming language that can be used to create macros. Macros are small programs that can be run automatically by a software program. A macro virus can be embedded in an electronic document, such as a Microsoft Word file, and will run when the document is opened. The virus will then infect the computer's memory and may spread to other files on the computer.	macro virus	Explain macro virus (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A macro virus is a computer virus that has the ability to infect entire word processing or spreadsheet documents by embedding itself in the macros associated with these applications.	macro virus	Explain macro virus (cybersecurity) using an analogy.

Malicious logic is like a virus that can infect your computer and make it do things you don't want it to do, like crash or steal your data.	malicious logic	Explain malicious logic (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Malicious logic is like a wolf in sheep's clothing. It looks innocent and helpful, but it's actually out to get you.	malicious logic	Explain malicious logic (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Malicious logic is like a hacker who breaks into a building and steals from the residents. The hacker uses their knowledge of how the security system works to get past the barriers that are in place to protect the people inside. Once they are in, they can steal whatever they want without anyone being able to stop them.	malicious logic	Explain malicious logic (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Malicious logic is like a virus or worm that is designed to attack and exploit computer systems. It can be used to steal data, damage systems, or take control of computers. Malicious logic can also be used to spread malware and ransomware infections.	malicious logic	Explain malicious logic (cybersecurity) using an analogy.

Malware is like a virus or disease in the physical world. Just as a virus can make you sick, malware can infect your computer and cause all sorts of problems.	malware	Explain malware (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity can be seen as a form of disaster recovery. Just as businesses have plans in place to recover from a fire or natural disaster, they also need to have plans in place to deal with cyberattacks. This includes having backup systems and procedures in place, as well as training employees on how to respond if an attack occurs.	mitigation	Explain mitigation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Mitigation, in the context of cybersecurity, can be thought of as locks on doors. Locks provide a barrier between potential intruders and the valuable information or resources inside a building. Similarly, cybersecurity measures (e.g., firewalls, antivirus software) act as barriers between potential cyber-intruders and the valuable data or systems within an organization. Like physical security measures (e.g., locks), cybersecurity measures are not foolproof but they can help to make it more difficult for malicious actors to gain access to sensitive information or systems.	mitigation	Explain mitigation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Mitigation is like putting up a fence around your house. It's not 100% effective, but it will help to deter criminals from trying to break in.	mitigation	Explain mitigation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Mitigation is a bit like putting up a fence around your house to keep burglars out. The fence may not be 100% effective, but it will make it harder for the burglars to get in, and will hopefully mean they move on to an easier target. Mitigation measures for cybersecurity work in a similar way – they make it more difficult for hackers to penetrate your system, and hopefully deter them from trying at all.	mitigation	Explain mitigation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Mitigation is like wearing a seatbelt while driving. It's not 100% guaranteed to prevent an accident, but it gives you a better chance of avoiding serious injury in the event of one. Similarly, using mitigation techniques in your cybersecurity strategy can help reduce your risk of being hacked or suffering a data breach.	mitigation	Explain mitigation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Moving target defense is like speeding up your car as you drive away from a pursuer. The idea is to make it harder for the attacker to predict where you will be and what you will do next. This makes it more difficult for them to mount an effective attack.	moving target defense	Explain moving target defense (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A moving target defense (cybersecurity) analogy could be using a strategy of always keeping your enemies guessing by changing your routine, deploying different tactics and maneuvers, and not allowing them to get comfortable. In the cybersecurity world, this means constantly adapting your security measures in response to new attacks and threats as they emerge. It also means being proactive in identifying potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities in your systems before an attacker can exploit them.	moving target defense	Explain moving target defense (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A moving target defense is like having a car that constantly changes its appearance. It might be painted black one minute and then blue the next. The headlights, taillights, and license plates might also change frequently. This would make it difficult for someone to track the car or rob it, since they wouldn't know what it looked like or where it was headed. In cybersecurity, a moving target defense is used to make it more difficult for hackers to track and attack your network. By constantly changing the IP addresses, passwords, and other security features, you can make it harder for them to find vulnerabilities in your system.	moving target defense	Explain moving target defense (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A moving target defense (MTD) is a cybersecurity strategy that aims to make it more difficult for an attacker to predict or anticipate the actions of the targeted system. This can be done by regularly changing system configurations, adding new security controls, and deploying countermeasures in near-real time. By making it harder for attackers to plan and execute successful attacks, MTD can help organizations reduce their risk of being compromised.	moving target defense	Explain moving target defense (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for moving target defense is to think of it as a game of chess. The King is the most important piece on the board, and the player's goal is to protect the king at all costs. However, if the player can only keep their king in one spot on the board, their opponent can easily surround and capture it. To avoid this, the player must constantly move their king around so that it's always in a different place. This same concept applies to cybersecurity; by constantly changing up your defenses (e.g., passwords, security protocols), you make it more difficult for hackers to find and exploit any vulnerabilities.	moving target defense	Explain moving target defense (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Think of a network as being like a group of people standing together in a circle. The more people there are in the circle, the stronger it is. If someone tries to break into the circle, they’ll have a harder time doing so if there are more people standing together.A cyberattack is like someone trying to break into that circle. A network with good resilience will be able to withstand that attack better than one without it.	network resilience	Explain network resilience (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A network is resilient if it can quickly and effectively restore normal operations following a cyberattack. This might be done, for example, by isolating the affected systems, identifying the source of the attack, and then taking steps to prevent future attacks. In some cases, a network might also have backup systems in place that can be activated in the event of an attack.	network resilience	Explain network resilience (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Network resilience can be best understood by analogy to human physiology. Just as the human body has many redundant systems (e.g., two kidneys, four lungs) that work together to maintain overall health and function in the event of injury or illness, a resilient cyber infrastructure similarly has multiple redundant systems that work together to maintain overall security and functionality in the event of an attack or incident.	network resilience	Explain network resilience (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Network resilience can be thought of as the body's immune system. Just as our immune system fights off disease and protects us from harmful invaders, a resilient network defends itself against cyberattacks and other threats. It does this by using measures such as firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems to identify and block any malicious activity. Like our immune system, a resilient network is constantly evolving to stay ahead of new threats.	network resilience	Explain network resilience (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cyber-resilient network is like a three legged stool. One leg is your data, one leg is your applications, and one leg is your infrastructure. If you lose any one of these legs, the stool falls over. To make the stool more resilient, you can add additional legs (more data, more applications, more infrastructure). This makes it more difficult for an attacker to take out all of your systems at once.	network resilience	Explain network resilience (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One way to think of network services is as the cyber equivalent of neighborhood watch. Just as neighbors look out for one another in a physical community, trusted members of a network can monitor and protect systems from unauthorized access or attack. In addition to deterring malicious behavior, these services can also help identify and respond to incidents quickly.	network services	Explain network services (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One way to think of network services is as the cyber equivalent of community policing. Just as a neighborhood watch can deter crime by increasing the chances that criminals will be caught, network security measures make it more difficult for hackers to succeed in their attacks. By identifying and blocking malicious traffic before it reaches your systems, you can help protect your data and prevent costly disruptions to your business.	network services	Explain network services (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Network services can be thought of as a set of locks on a door. The locks (services) can be opened with a key (password), which is known only to the person who wants to open the door (the owner of the network). Without the key, the locks cannot be opened, and the door remains closed.	network services	Explain network services (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Network services can be thought of as the cyber equivalent of a neighborhood watch. They are responsible for monitoring and protecting the network from unauthorized access or use, as well as helping to maintain its security overall. This includes things like installing and updating security software, blocking malicious traffic, and identifying and responding to any threats or incidents that may occur.	network services	Explain network services (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity can be thought of as a "defense in depth" strategy. Just like you would have several layers of security - such as a fence, security cameras, and an alarm system - on your property to protect it from thieves, you need several layers of cybersecurity protection to protect your computer networks from hackers.	network services	Explain network services (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Non-repudiation is like a receipt you get from a store after buying something. The receipt proves that you bought the item and it's yours. Non-repudiation in cybersecurity means that someone can't deny they did something online or sent a message, because there's proof that they did it.	non-repudiation	Explain non-repudiation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A customer makes a purchase at a store with a credit card. The customer has the option to dispute the charge if they believe something is wrong with their purchase. The credit card company can help resolve the dispute by looking at the evidence from both the customer and the store. This process helps ensure that neither party can successfully deny making the purchase. In cybersecurity, non-repudiation is used to ensure that an attacker cannot deny their involvement in an attack or delete their tracks after carrying out an attack.	non-repudiation	Explain non-repudiation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If someone hands you an envelope, you might expect that the contents are what the person said they would be. You can be reasonably sure that the person who gave you the envelope won't later deny giving it to you. Non-repudiation is a way of ensuring this property in digital contexts: if I send you an email, for example, I want to make sure that I can't later claim that I never sent it. One way of providing non-repudiation is by using cryptographic signatures; these ensure that the message was actually sent from me and wasn't tampered with along the way.	non-repudiation	Explain non-repudiation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Digital signatures provide a way for the signer of a message to prove that they created the message, and that the message has not been changed since it was signed. This property is called non-repudiation, because it prevents the signer from denying that they created the message.	non-repudiation	Explain non-repudiation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One common analogy used to explain non-repudiation is that of a signed contract. A signature on a contract is meant to provide assurance that the person signing the document agrees to its contents. In the same way, a digital signature can be used to provide assurance that the sender of a message truly intended to send it and has not been compromised.	non-repudiation	Explain non-repudiation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A firewall is like a bouncer at a nightclub. It checks the ID of everyone who tries to enter the club and only lets in people who are allowed inside. A firewall does the same thing with computer traffic, checking every packet of data that comes into or goes out of your network to make sure it's safe.	object	Explain object (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
It is a system that protects your computer or online account from being hacked.	object	Explain object (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A firewall can be thought of as a bouncer at a nightclub. The job of the bouncer is to make sure that only people who are allowed into the club are able to get in, and to keep out those who aren't authorized to enter. Similarly, firewalls work by restricting access to certain parts of a computer or network, allowing only authorized users to access them.	object	Explain object (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A firewall can be thought of as a bouncer in a nightclub. The firewall is responsible for deciding which traffic is allowed to enter the network and which traffic is denied.	object	Explain object (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like a fence that surrounds your property. It helps to keep people out and protect your belongings.	object	Explain object (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Maintaining cybersecurity is like maintaining a car. You have to keep up with the regular maintenance (oil changes, tune-ups, etc.) in order to keep it running smoothly. If you don't, it will start to break down and you'll end up paying more in repairs. The same goes for your computer - if you don't keep up with the regular security updates and scans, your computer will be more susceptible to attacks and viruses.	operate &amp; maintain	Explain operate &amp; maintain (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Operate and maintain (cybersecurity) is like keeping your car clean and running well. Just as you have to keep up with the oil changes, tune-ups and general maintenance on your car, you need to do the same for your cybersecurity systems. You also have to keep an eye out for potential threats and be prepared to respond quickly if something happens.	operate &amp; maintain	Explain operate &amp; maintain (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Operate and maintain (cybersecurity) can be explained using an analogy of a car. Just as you need to operate and maintain your car in order for it to run smoothly, you need to operate and maintain your cybersecurity systems in order for them to function properly and keep your data safe.	operate &amp; maintain	Explain operate &amp; maintain (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Operating and maintaining cybersecurity is similar to running a home security system. The homeowner must keep the system up-to-date with new technology, test it regularly to make sure it is working properly, and be aware of any changes in their environment that may impact its effectiveness (such as moving to a new house).	operate &amp; maintain	Explain operate &amp; maintain (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Operating and maintaining cybersecurity is like keeping your car in good condition. You need to keep up with the regular maintenance (tires, oil changes, etc.), and you also need to be aware of any potential problems so that you can address them before they become a bigger issue.	operate &amp; maintain	Explain operate &amp; maintain (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity operational exercise is like a fire drill. Just as you would practice evacuating your building in the event of a real fire, you need to test your ability to respond to a cyber incident. This includes everything from identifying the threat to containing and eradicating it. By running through these scenarios regularly, you can improve your response time and make sure that your team is prepared for anything.	operational exercise	Explain operational exercise (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy of an operational exercise in cybersecurity is that it is like a fire drill. Operational exercises are meant to test and evaluate the readiness of an organization to respond to a potential cyber incident. Just as firefighters need to practice how they would fight a fire in order to be prepared if one were to occur, organizations also need to practice their response plan for a possible cyber incident. By doing so, they can identify any gaps or deficiencies in their security posture and work towards fixing them.	operational exercise	Explain operational exercise (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity operational exercise is like a fire drill. The purpose of a fire drill is to rehearsed how to respond in the event of a real emergency. In a similar way, the purpose of a cybersecurity operational exercise is to rehearse how to respond in the event of a cyber attack.	operational exercise	Explain operational exercise (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
An operational exercise (cybersecurity) can be best described as a fire drill. Just as individuals and organizations conduct fire drills in order to practice their response to a potential fire, they should also participate in operational exercises (cybersecurity) to practice their response to a potential cyber incident. This allows them to test their plans, identify any deficiencies, and make necessary adjustments before an actual event occurs.	operational exercise	Explain operational exercise (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Operational exercise (cybersecurity) can be compared to a fire drill. Just as people participate in fire drills to prepare for the possibility of a real-life fire, individuals and organizations engage in cybersecurity exercises to better protect themselves from cyberattacks. By practicing how they would respond to different types of threats, individuals and businesses can improve their ability to mitigate damage, minimize loss of data, and prevent further spread of infection.	operational exercise	Explain operational exercise (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Operations technology (cybersecurity) can be analogized to locking your car doors. Just as you wouldn't leave your car unlocked with the windows down on a hot day, you also wouldn't leave your computer or network unprotected from malicious actors. Locking your car doors keeps thieves from stealing your belongings and damaging your vehicle, and cyber security measures do the same for electronic information.	operations technology	Explain operations technology (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Operations technology can be thought of as the “immune system” of a business. Just as your body fights off infection and disease to keep you healthy, operations technology protects a business from cyberattacks and other online threats. By securing networks and systems, Operations Technology keeps hackers out and helps ensure the privacy and safety of customer data.	operations technology	Explain operations technology (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Operations technology (cybersecurity) can be thought of as the electronic equivalent of a locked door. The locks on doors keep people out, and cybersecurity keeps unauthorized individuals from accessing or tampering with computer systems.	operations technology	Explain operations technology (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Operations technology (cybersecurity) can be thought of as a locked gate that prohibits unauthorized access to a property. The lock on the gate is the cybersecurity measure, and it is used to keep people out who are not authorized to enter.	operations technology	Explain operations technology (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Operations technology (cybersecurity) can be thought of as locks on doors. Locks keep people out of places they shouldn't be, and cybersecurity keeps unauthorized people from accessing computer networks and data. Just like having strong locks on your doors can help protect you and your family, having strong cybersecurity measures in place can help protect an organization's information and assets.	operations technology	Explain operations technology (cybersecurity) using an analogy.

Development of a cyber security program is analogous to the development of a new product. The first step in any successful product development process is to come up with a good idea. In the case of cybersecurity, this would involve thinking about all possible ways that an attacker could try to penetrate your network and then taking steps to prevent those attacks from happening.The next step is to design and build a prototype of the product. In the case of cybersecurity, this would involve creating firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other tools that can help protect your network. Once the prototype is completed, it needs to be tested in order to make sure that it works correctly and meets your requirements.The final step is to launch the product into the market. In the case of cybersecurity, this would mean making sure that your networks are properly protected and informing your employees about how they should use these new security measures.	oversight &amp; development	Explain oversight &amp; development (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Oversight and development in cybersecurity can be thought of as the construction of a house. The oversight is akin to making sure the foundation is strong and well-built, while the development is like adding new rooms, painting, and putting in furniture. Both are important for creating a safe and functional home. In the same way, both oversight and development are important for creating a strong and effective cybersecurity program. Oversight ensures that foundational elements such as risk management processes are in place, while development keeps pace with new technologies and threats.	oversight &amp; development	Explain oversight &amp; development (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Oversight can be compared to parenting. Parents are responsible for their children and must ensure they are safe, fed, clothed, and loved. They must also provide guidance and discipline when needed. In the same way, agencies that oversee cybersecurity must make sure networks and systems are protected from attack, fed with updated security information, properly clothed in security solutions, and receive continual love in the form of maintenance and improvements. Just as a child needs different forms of attention at different stages of development, so too does cybersecurity require different approaches at different times. Agencies must continually monitor threats and vulnerabilities while planning ahead for future needs.	oversight &amp; development	Explain oversight &amp; development (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Just as a supervisor oversees the safety of their employees in the workplace, governments and other institutions responsible for cybersecurity are responsible for safeguarding users from potential cyber threats. Cybersecurity is an ever-evolving field, so supervisors (or "cybersecurity experts") must continually update their knowledge and tools to protect systems and data. Similarly, developers release new software updates to patch vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit.	oversight &amp; development	Explain oversight &amp; development (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Oversight and development in cybersecurity can be compared to the parents of a teenager. The parents are responsible for monitoring their child’s activities, making sure they are safe, and helping them grow into adulthood. In the same way, organizations need to monitor their systems for potential threats, make sure their defenses are up-to-date, and work to improve their security posture over time.	oversight &amp; development	Explain oversight &amp; development (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Passive attacks are like thieves who sit in a parked car and watch people go into their homes, looking for an opportunity to rob them when they leave. The thief doesn't have to do anything except wait; once the victim leaves home, the robbery can take place without the thief even having to get out of the car.	passive attack	Explain passive attack (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A passive attack on a computer system is like someone breaking into your house through an unlocked door while you are at work.

Cybersecurity is like recovering from surgery. Just as you would take time to heal and recover from an operation, you should also take time to ensure your cybersecurity practices are in place so you can protect your systems and data.	recovery	Explain recovery (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A recovery (cybersecurity) analogy can be made to the human body's natural ability to heal itself. In much the same way that our bodies have self-healing mechanisms, cybersecurity solutions also have a built-in capacity for self-repair. Security software and hardware are constantly updated with new patches and protection protocols in order to maintain system security. When a cyberattack occurs, these updates help to neutralize the threat and protect against future attacks.	recovery	Explain recovery (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Recovery from a cybersecurity incident is similar to recovering from a natural disaster. Just as businesses and homeowners must rebuild after a hurricane or tornado destroys their property, they must also take steps to rebuild their cybersecurity protections after an attack. This includes re-evaluating security protocols, installing new software and hardware, and training employees on how to protect themselves online.	recovery	Explain recovery (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Red teaming is a process where you attack your own organization as if you were an outsider. This helps to find vulnerabilities and improve security. It can be thought of as a way of “testing the defense” by simulating an attack from a real or imagined adversary.	red team	Explain red team (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A red team is like a group of military special forces soldiers who are trying to infiltrate an enemy's defenses. They use their creativity and skills to find new ways to attack, and they are always looking for weaknesses in the enemy's armor. Red teams help organizations prepare for cyberattacks by simulating real-world attacks on their systems.	red team	Explain red team (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Red teaming is similar to playing the role of an attacker in a cybersecurity exercise. The red team's goal is to find and exploit vulnerabilities in the system so that the organization can improve its defenses.	red team	Explain red team (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A red team is a group of experts who are hired to attack an organization's systems and find vulnerabilities. This is similar to how the military uses red teams to test their defenses by attacking them. The goal of a red team is to help organizations identify and fix security holes before they can be exploited by real attackers.	red team	Explain red team (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Think of a red team as a group of people who are specifically hired to try and break into your company's computer systems. They use their knowledge of hacking techniques and strategies to attempt to find any weak spots in your security defenses so that you can fix them before someone with malicious intent does.	red team	Explain red team (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A red team exercise simulates a real-world attack against an organization's computer systems. The goal of the exercise is to identify weaknesses in the organization's security defenses and fix them before a real attack can occur. Red team exercises are often used by businesses, government agencies, and military organizations to test their cybersecurity preparedness.	red team exercise	Explain red team exercise (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A red team exercise is a simulated attack against an organization's cybersecurity defenses. The goal of the exercise is to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the organization's security infrastructure. Red team exercises can be used to test both technical and human aspects of an organization's security posture.	red team exercise	Explain red team exercise (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A red team exercise is a cyber security drill that tests the ability of an organization to protect its computer networks and systems from attack. The exercise is designed to simulate a real world scenario in which hackers attempt to penetrate the network and steal information or damage critical infrastructure. The goal of the red team is to identify weaknesses in the system and fix them before they can be exploited by hackers.	red team exercise	Explain red team exercise (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Red team exercises are typically used in the context of cybersecurity as a way to test an organization's defenses by simulating an attack. In this type of exercise, a red team is given access to systems and data within the organization and proceeds to try to penetrate them using various methods. The goal is for the blue team (the defenders) to detect and respond to the attacks as if they were real. This allows organizations to identify any weak points in their security posture and make necessary improvements.	red team exercise	Explain red team exercise (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A red team exercise is like an attack on a company's computer systems. The goal of the exercise is to find and fix vulnerabilities in the system before they can be exploited by real attackers.	red team exercise	Explain red team exercise (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cyber security analogy for redundancy would be as follows: You are in a large city and you are walking to your destination. You have a choice of two routes, both of which will get you there. However, one route is shorter and easier, while the other route is longer but has more amenities (sidewalks, stores, etc.). In this scenario, taking the shorter but less comfortable route would be analogous to having basic cybersecurity measures in place (e.g., firewalls, antivirus software), while taking the longer but more comfortable route would be analogous to having additional layers of security in place (e.g., intrusion detection/prevention systems, honeypots).	redundancy	Explain redundancy (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Redundancy is like having a backup of your files. If your computer crashes, you can still access your files because you have them saved on another device. In the world of cybersecurity, redundancy means having multiple layers of security in place to protect your data. This could include using different passwords for each account, installing antivirus software, and backing up your data regularly.	redundancy	Explain redundancy (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Redundancy is like having a spare tire in your car. If you get a flat, you can change the tire yourself instead of calling for help. Cybersecurity redundancy is having multiple ways to protect your computer networks from attack so that if one system fails, another will still work.	redundancy	Explain redundancy (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Redundancy can be thought of as a backup system. Just like if your car's engine fails, you want to have a spare in the trunk, if your computer is hacked, you want another line of defense to protect your data. This could mean having multiple email addresses, passwords, or computer systems.	redundancy	Explain redundancy (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One way to think of redundancy is as a backup plan. If your computer is infected with a virus, you can reinstall the operating system from the backup. This will restore your computer to its previous state, before the infection occurred. Redundancy works in a similar way. By having multiple copies of data, you can ensure that if one version is corrupted or destroyed, you still have access to the information you need.	redundancy	Explain redundancy (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Resilience can be thought of as a fortress with many layers of security. Each layer is designed to withstand different kinds of attacks, and if one layer fails, the next layer can still provide protection. Similarly, in cybersecurity, resilience means having multiple layers of security in place so that if one system is breached, others are still protected. This helps ensure that your data remains safe even if individual systems are compromised.	resilience	Explain resilience (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Resilience can be thought of as the ability of a system to absorb and recover from disruptions. In the context of cybersecurity, this would mean being able to quickly restore systems and services after an attack or other disruption.	resilience	Explain resilience (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you imagine cybersecurity as a building, resilience would be the ability of that building to withstand an attack and continue functioning. Resilience is all about being prepared for when something goes wrong and having a plan in place to restore normal operations as quickly as possible. In the world of cybersecurity, this means having backup systems in place and being able to respond quickly to any threats or incidents.	resilience	Explain resilience (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Resilience (cybersecurity) can be analogized to a seatbelt. A seatbelt is not just for one event, but it provides protection during all events. Similarly, resilience (cybersecurity) is not just for one incident, but it provides protection during all incidents.	resilience	Explain resilience (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
 resilience is like a rubber band. It can be stretched but it always snaps back to its original size. In the context of cybersecurity, this means that a cyber-attack may cause temporary damage or disruption but the system will eventually return to its normal state.	resilience	Explain resilience (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If a cyberattack is like an intruder breaking into your home, then cybersecurity measures are like having strong locks on your doors and windows. They make it more difficult for the attacker to get in, and may even deter them from trying in the first place.	response	Explain response (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
It is like locking your car doors when you are not in it. You are taking a measure to protect yourself from someone who may want to steal your car.	response	Explain response (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cyberattack is like a robber breaking into your home. Your security system is like the locks on your doors and windows. The more layers of protection you have, the better protected you are from an attack.	response	Explain response (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One common analogy for cybersecurity is personal hygiene. Just as it is important to wash your hands regularly to avoid spreading germs and getting sick, it is important to take similar precautions with your digital devices in order to protect yourself from cyber threats. This means using security software, being careful about what links you click on, and avoiding disclosing sensitive information online.	response	Explain response (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like a lock on your door. It makes it harder for someone to get in without your permission.	response	Explain response (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A response plan is like a fire drill. You have to have one in place so that you know what to do when there is a fire. In the same way, you need a cybersecurity response plan so that you know what to do when your network is hacked.	response plan	Explain response plan (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity response plan is like a fire drill. You have a specific plan in place for what to do if there is a fire in your building. This includes who will do what and when, as well as where people will go. The same goes for cybersecurity. You have a specific plan in place for what to do if your network is attacked. This includes who will do what and when, as well as where people will go.	response plan	Explain response plan (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A response plan is like a fire drill. You have the plan in place, and when something happens, you know what to do. Your cybersecurity response plan should be similar. You should have a plan for how you will respond to different types of cyberattacks, and you should test your plan regularly.	response plan	Explain response plan (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity response plan is a little bit like a fire drill. In both cases, people have to know what to do when something goes wrong. With a fire drill, everyone knows where the exit is and how to get out of the building safely. With a cybersecurity response plan, everyone knows what they need to do if there is a cyberattack. They might need to shut down their computer, or call IT for help.	response plan	Explain response plan (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A response plan for cybersecurity is similar to creating a disaster recovery plan. Just as you would have a backup plan in case of a flood or fire, you need to have measures in place to protect your computer systems from attacks. This might include installing software that can detect and block malicious code, creating passwords that are difficult to guess, and establishing rules for using company computers.	response plan	Explain response plan (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
When you get in a car, there is always a risk that you will be in an accident. The same is true with cybersecurity. There is always a risk that your computer or information could be hacked or stolen.	risk	Explain risk (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Risk can be thought of as a kind of like insurance. You pay a little bit each month to your insurance company in case something bad happens, and if it does, they help you recover from it. With risk (cybersecurity), you are doing the same thing - paying a little bit each month so that if something bad happens, you have money to help you recover.	risk	Explain risk (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One common analogy used to explain risk is that of a home insurance policy. Imagine that you are a homeowner and have a $200,000 house. Your insurer offers you a policy with a $500 deductible. This means that if your house were to burn down, the insurer would pay out $200,000 minus the $500 deductible, or $199,500. So in this case, the homeowner would bear the first $500 of any loss. Now imagine that instead of having a $200,000 house burning down, you had a $1 million one. In this case, even though your policy has the same deductible amount ($500), because your loss is greater than before (from $200K to 1M), you would be entitled to receive more money from your insurer - in this example, up to$999,500). In both cases - whether your home burns down for just 200k or 1 million dollars- you are still covered for 500 bucks worth of damage! The lesson: having more coverage (a higher limit) does not increase your costs (deductible) but it will protect you better in case something really bad happens (like your home burning down completely). This analogy can be used when explaining cybersecurity risk as well. Imagine that there is a hacker who wants to break into your computer and steal all of your data. They may try again and again until they succeed - just like how someone might try repeatedly to rob your house. And just like with fire insurance, having better cybersecurity protection means that you will be less likely to suffer losses if someone does manage to break in (e.g., they may only be able to steal limited amounts of data rather than everything on your computer).	risk	Explain risk (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like driving a car. The more you drive, the more likely you are to have an accident. The same is true with cybersecurity. The more you use your computer and the Internet, the more likely you are to be hacked or infected with a virus.	risk	Explain risk (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Risk (cybersecurity) is like a house on fire. Your computer is the house, and the things you have stored on it are the valuable possessions inside. The risk of your computer catching on fire is low, but if it does happen, your possessions will be destroyed.	risk	Explain risk (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A risk analysis is like a doctor's check-up. The doctor checks different areas of your body for potential problems and offers solutions to address any issues they find. A risk analyst does the same thing for your computer system, looking for vulnerabilities that could lead to a data breach or other cyber incident. They then recommend steps to take to fix these issues and protect your organization from cyber threats.	risk analysis	Explain risk analysis (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Risk analysis is like a doctor examining a patient. The doctor looks at the symptoms and tries to determine what might be wrong. They then decide on a course of treatment based on their findings. Similarly, in risk analysis we try to identify the risks that our organization faces and figure out how best to deal with them. We may not be able to eliminate all risk, but by understanding what they are we can put in place measures to protect ourselves from as much as possible.	risk analysis	Explain risk analysis (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Risk analysis is like a doctor examining a patient. The doctor looks at the symptoms and determines what could be wrong. Then, the doctor decides on a course of treatment based on the risk to the patient.	risk analysis	Explain risk analysis (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Risk analysis is like a grocery store. The store has many different items, and the shoppers have to decide what they want to put in their carts. Some of the items might be risky, but the shoppers have to decide if the risk is worth it. They also have to decide how much of each item they want.	risk analysis	Explain risk analysis (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The process of risk analysis can be thought of as a grocery store. The store has many different items for sale, and the customer wants to make sure they get the most value for their money. They weigh the pros and cons of each item before making a purchase. In much the same way, risk analysts evaluate potential risks and assess how likely they are to occur, along with their possible impacts. This allows organizations to make informed decisions about what security measures to take in order to protect themselves from cyber threats.	risk analysis	Explain risk analysis (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Risk assessment is the process of identifying, quantifying, and mitigating risks to an organization's information security. It involves analyzing potential threats and vulnerabilities to systems and data, and then developing countermeasures to minimize risk. An analogy for risk assessment would be a person looking both ways before crossing the street. By identifying potential hazards (cars speeding down the street), they can take steps to reduce their exposure (walking across at a crosswalk).	risk assessment	Explain risk assessment (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Risk assessment (cybersecurity) is a bit like assessing whether or not to wear a seat belt when driving. The risk of an accident may be small, but it's still worth taking precautions to avoid potential injury. In the same way, businesses should assess the risks associated with cybersecurity and take steps to mitigate any potential damage.	risk assessment	Explain risk assessment (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Risk assessment is like a doctor examining a patient. The doctor looks at the symptoms, performs some tests, and then comes up with a diagnosis. They may also recommend treatment based on their findings.The same process applies to risk assessment in cybersecurity. You look at the symptoms (e.g., unusual activity or files being deleted), perform some tests (e.g., scanning your systems for vulnerabilities), and then come up with a diagnosis (e.g., you have been hacked). You may also need to take corrective action based on your findings (e.g., patching your systems).	risk assessment	Explain risk assessment (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A risk assessment can be thought of as a grocery list for your cybersecurity diet. It is a comprehensive examination of the potential threats and vulnerabilities that could affect an organization’s computer networks and systems. By understanding these risks, organizations can identify and implement the necessary security measures to protect against them.	risk assessment	Explain risk assessment (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A risk assessment is like a personal security guard who examines all the potential dangers and threats to your safety and then creates a plan to protect you from them.	risk assessment	Explain risk assessment (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Risk management (cybersecurity) is like firefighting. Firefighters have to identify potential fires and take steps to prevent them from happening, but they also have to be prepared for when a fire does break out. They need to have the right equipment and know how to use it, and they need to keep their skills sharp so that they can put out the fire as quickly as possible.	risk management	Explain risk management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like a bank. The bank has many customers and each customer has money in the bank. The bank wants to keep track of how much money each customer has so they can ensure that no one overdraws their account. Similarly, cybersecurity wants to track how much data each user has access to so they can ensure that no user exceeds their allowed limit.	risk management	Explain risk management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Risk management is like buying insurance. You hope you never have to use it, but you're glad you have it if something happens.	risk management	Explain risk management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Risk management can be seen as like a carpenter using a toolbox. The carpenter has many tools in their tool box, each with its own specific purpose. In the same way, a risk manager has many tools at their disposal to help them mitigate cyber risks. These tools might include things like intrusion detection and prevention systems, firewalls, patch management software, and user training. By using these tools effectively, the risk manager can help protect their organization from potential cyber threats.	risk management	Explain risk management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Risk management is like riding a bike. You need to be aware of the risks (e.g., traffic, potholes, wind) and take actions to mitigate them (e.g., wear a helmet, use hand signals). In the context of cybersecurity, this means being aware of the potential threats (e.g., viruses, hackers) and taking steps to protect your computer or network (e.g., installing antivirus software, password-protecting your devices).	risk management	Explain risk management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Risk mitigation is like wearing a seatbelt while driving. It's not 100% guaranteed to keep you safe, but it significantly reduces the chance of being injured in an accident. Similarly, risk mitigation (cybersecurity) measures reduce the chances of your organization being hacked or compromised.	risk mitigation	Explain risk mitigation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Risk mitigation is the process of reducing or eliminating potential risks to an organization's computer systems and data. An analogy would be that risk mitigation is like putting on a seat belt while driving. It may not prevent an accident from happening, but it will help to reduce the severity of injuries if one does occur. In the same way, risk mitigation measures for cybersecurity can help organizations protect their computer systems and data from potential cyberattacks.	risk mitigation	Explain risk mitigation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Risk mitigation using cybersecurity is like locking your car doors when you park it in a busy city lot. You are still taking a risk that someone may break into your car, but you are doing what you can to minimize that risk. Similarly, by using strong passwords and security measures, you are minimizing the chances of someone breaking into your computer and stealing your information.	risk mitigation	Explain risk mitigation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Risk mitigation is like putting on a seatbelt when you get in your car. You are not 100% safe, but you are doing everything possible to protect yourself from injury in the event of an accident.	risk mitigation	Explain risk mitigation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is like a lock on your door. It helps to keep you safe by preventing people from getting into your house without permission.	risk mitigation	Explain risk mitigation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Risk-based data management is like a car. You can't just drive it without any regard to the risks involved in doing so. You need to think about things like how fast you're going, whether you're using your turn signals, and what's happening around you. The same goes for data management. You need to be aware of the risks involved in storing and accessing your data and take steps to mitigate those risks.	risk-based data management	Explain risk-based data management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Risk-based data management is like locking your car. You may not need to do it every time you leave your car, but if you lock it, you're less likely to have something stolen from inside. The same goes for data security - by identifying and managing the risks associated with your data, you can better protect it from unauthorized access or theft.	risk-based data management	Explain risk-based data management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Risk-based data management is like keeping your car in the garage. If you keep your car in the garage, it will be safe from weather and thieves. However, if you leave your car outside, it is vulnerable to bad weather and theft.	risk-based data management	Explain risk-based data management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Risk-based data management (cybersecurity) can be explained using the analogy of a bank. A bank has different levels of security based on how much money it has in its vault. The more money a bank has, the more secure its doors and walls need to be. Bank employees also have different levels of security clearance, depending on what kind of information they have access to.	risk-based data management	Explain risk-based data management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for risk-based data management is to imagine your house. Imagine that you have a small, low value item in your home and a very expensive, high-value item in your home. You are much more likely to take precautions with the high-value item than you are with the small, low value item. This is analogous to how businesses approach cybersecurity. They are much more likely to protect valuable assets (such as customer data) than they are less valuable assets (such as employee contact information).	risk-based data management	Explain risk-based data management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Imagine you are a burglar who has just broken into a home. You have covered your tracks, so the homeowner can't tell that someone has been in the house. This is what a rootkit does on a computer - it hides the fact that someone has hacked into the system.	rootkit	Explain rootkit (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A rootkit is a cybersecurity tool that allows an attacker to maintain access to a computer or network even after the system has been compromised. It does this by installing hidden software on the system that gives the attacker backdoor access and control.	rootkit	Explain rootkit (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A rootkit is a type of software that hides the presence of other software on a computer. It can be used to hide malicious code, or to keep users from knowing that their computer has been compromised.	rootkit	Explain rootkit (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A rootkit is a set of software tools that enable an attacker to gain root-level access to a system, typically without the owner's knowledge. This would allow the attacker to take control of the system, install additional software or steal data from it.	rootkit	Explain rootkit (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A rootkit is a program that gives an attacker unauthorized access to a computer or network. It can be used to hide the presence of other programs, files, or activities on a computer.	rootkit	Explain rootkit (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A secret key is a password that only the user and recipient know. It is used to decrypt or encode data so that it can be read only by the intended user.	secret key	Explain secret key (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A secret key is like a password that you use to unlock your phone or computer. It's a code that only you and the person you share it with know.	secret key	Explain secret key (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A secret key is like a password that you use to unlock your phone.	secret key	Explain secret key (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Secret key is like a password. It is a secret that only you and the person you are communicating with knows.	secret key	Explain secret key (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The secret key is like a password that you use to log into your email account. It is something that only you know, and it is used to encrypt and decrypt data.	secret key	Explain secret key (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A company might use a safe to securely store important papers. The combination to the safe is known only by the company's employees. To access the documents, an employee would need to know the combination and have permission from management.	securely provision	Explain securely provision (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Secure provision can be likened to locking your front door. You may have a key that will allow you to open the door, but someone who doesn't have the key won't be able to get in. In the same way, secure provision allows authorized personnel access to systems and information while denying access to unauthorized individuals.	securely provision	Explain securely provision (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you want to buy a new car, you might go to a dealership. The dealer will have a variety of different cars for you to choose from. They will also have staff who can help you find the perfect car for your needs and budget. Once you've found the right car, the dealer will work with you to get it registered and insured.The analogy for secure provision is that dealers are like cybersecurity providers. They have a variety of different products and services for you to choose from, and they can help you find the perfect solution for your needs and budget. Once you've found the right product or service, the provider will work with you to get it set up and running.	securely provision	Explain securely provision (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
You can think of securely provisioning as being a bit like locking your front door. It’s something that you do to make sure that only the people who are supposed to be in your house can get in, and that no one else can get in without permission. Similarly, when you securely provision your computer or network, you’re making sure that only authorized users can access it and that unauthorized users (or malware) can’t get in.	securely provision	Explain securely provision (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Secure provisioning is similar to locking your front door when you leave for the day. You are taking preventative measures to make sure that no one can enter your home without permission while you are away. In the same way, by securely provisioning your devices and networks, you are preventing unauthorized access and protecting yourself from cyberattacks.	securely provision	Explain securely provision (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Security automation is like a car alarm. It's a tool that helps you protect your vehicle from theft. Security automation (cybersecurity) is a tool that helps you protect your computer systems, networks and data from theft or damage.	security automation	Explain security automation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for security automation is the use of a burglar alarm in a home. A burglar alarm can be set to automatically sound when someone opens a door or window, even if the homeowner is not at home. This provides an extra level of security by deterring potential burglars and also alerting the homeowner or authorities if someone does attempt to break into the home. Security automation in cybersecurity works in a similar way, by using technology to automatically detect and respond to threats, without requiring human intervention. This can help organizations protect their networks and data from cyberattacks more effectively and quickly.	security automation	Explain security automation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A physical security analogy for cyber security would be the use of locks on doors to prevent unauthorized entry. Security automation in cyber space is analogous to using an electronic keypad instead of a physical key to unlock a door. The keypad requires a code that is known only by authorized individuals in order to open the door.	security automation	Explain security automation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for security automation is the use of an autopilot in a plane. Security automation refers to the use of software or other mechanisms to monitor and manage cybersecurity risk automatically. Just as an autopilot can maintain flight parameters without input from the pilot, security automation can monitor systems and networks for signs of intrusion or other problems and take corrective action automatically. This can help reduce the strain on human resources, freeing up employees to focus on more strategic tasks and improving overall security posture.	security automation	Explain security automation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One way to think of security automation is as a “cybersecurity autopilot.” It is a system that can be used to help manage and monitor your organization’s cybersecurity posture in real-time, using predefined rules and policies. Security automation can also help you respond more quickly and effectively to cyber threats.	security automation	Explain security automation (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity incident is like a home invasion. Just as someone can break into your house and steal your belongings, someone can access your computer files and steal your information. Similarly, you may install security measures in your home such as alarm systems and locks to deter thieves, you can also install security software on your computer to protect against cybercrime.	security incident	Explain security incident (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A security incident can be best described as being similar to a home invasion. Just like when someone breaks into your house, takes your belongings and leaves, a cybercriminal can enter your computer system, take information and leave without you even knowing it happened.	security incident	Explain security incident (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity incident can be thought of as a house burglary. In both cases, someone has unlawfully accessed and taken something that belongs to someone else. The main difference is that in the case of a cybersecurity incident, the "something" that has been taken is often information (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers, etc.), whereas in the case of a house burglary, the "something" may be physical objects such as jewelry or money.	security incident	Explain security incident (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cyber breach or attack can be thought of as a home invasion. Just as an intruder can enter your home through an unlocked door or window, a hacker can exploit vulnerabilities in your systems to gain access to your data. Once inside, they can steal information, wreak havoc on your systems, and even hold your data hostage for ransom.	security incident	Explain security incident (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A security incident can be thought of as a burglary. Just like when someone breaks into your house and steals your belongings, a cybercriminal can break into your computer and steal your information.	security incident	Explain security incident (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A security policy is like a fence around your house. It keeps the bad guys out and safe inside.	security policy	Explain security policy (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
In the world of cybersecurity, a security policy is equivalent to a set of rules that employees must follow in order to keep the company's data and systems safe from harm. Just as with any other organization, if everyone follows the same set of safety guidelines, it makes it much easier for everyone to stay safe. Likewise, in the cyberworld, having a well-defined security policy helps ensure that all employees are aware of how to protect the company's digital assets.	security policy	Explain security policy (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A security policy can be thought of as a map that shows the safest way to navigate through a city. The map identifies areas of risk and highlights precautions that should be taken in order to avoid them. A security policy for a computer network works in much the same way, identifying high-risk areas (such as email servers) and outlining steps that need to be taken to protect them from attack (such as installing antivirus software).	security policy	Explain security policy (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Hi, I’m your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. I protect your house from burglars and other bad guys who want to do harm. I am the security policy for your house.	security policy	Explain security policy (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity policy is like a speed limit. It is a set of rules that people are expected to follow in order to keep everyone safe. Similarly, a cybersecurity policy is meant to keep everyone safe online by creating rules for how people should behave when using the internet.	security policy	Explain security policy (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is a bit like traffic management. You have to think about how people are going to move around, what routes they will take, and how to make sure that everyone can get where they need to go without running into too many obstacles. You also need to plan for emergencies and make sure that everyone knows what to do if something goes wrong.	security program management	Explain security program management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The analogy that comes to mind is that of a ship captain. The security program manager (cybersecurity) is responsible for the safety of the ship and its crew, cargo, and passengers. They must maintain a safe environment by making sure all systems are working properly and are up-to-date, monitoring weather conditions and updating course as necessary, and responding quickly to emergencies.	security program management	Explain security program management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Just as a city planner must manage the various aspects of a city to keep it running efficiently and safely, a security program manager (cybersecurity) must manage the various aspects of a company's cybersecurity program to protect its computer networks and data. They must develop policies and procedures, allocate resources, monitor activity, identify and respond to threats, and train employees.	security program management	Explain security program management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for security program management is that it functions much like a traffic police department in a city. Security program management (cybersecurity) oversees the flow of information within an organization in order to protect its assets and ensure compliance with security policies. Just as traffic police work to keep vehicles moving efficiently and safely through a city, so too does security program management work to keep data flowing securely through an organization's networks.	security program management	Explain security program management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity can be compared to the security of a physical building. Just as a building needs doors, windows, and locks to keep people out, a computer needs software programs and firewalls to keep hackers out.

Spam is like when a person stands on a busy street corner and shouts out random things to people walking by. The person doing the shouting is trying to get the attention of as many people as possible, even if they don't want it. Spammers do the same thing with emails, sending them to as many people as possible, in the hope that someone will bite.	spam	Explain spam (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Spam is like a can of sardines. It's cheap, it fills you up, and there's a lot of it. But eventually you get tired of the taste, and you wish you'd never opened the can in the first place.	spam	Explain spam (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Spam is a lot like junk mail that you might receive in your physical mailbox. It's usually just clutter and it's not something that you asked for or wanted. Spam (cybersecurity) is the same way - it's an unsolicited message or file that you didn't ask for and don't want.	spam	Explain spam (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Spam is like a virus. It's an unwanted message that is sent to you over and over again.	spam	Explain spam (cybersecurity) using an analogy.

Spillage is like when a glass of water is spilled on the floor. The water spreads out and seeps into every crack and crevice it can find. In the same way, a cyberattack can exploit any vulnerability it finds in order to spread throughout a network and access sensitive data.	spillage	Explain spillage (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A spillage is like a water leak. It's when confidential or secret information is released to people who aren't supposed to have it.	spillage	Explain spillage (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Spillage is when a liquid or some other substance escapes from its container. In the cybersecurity context, spillage refers to the unauthorized release of data. This could happen, for example, if someone hacks into a company's network and accesses confidential information.	spillage	Explain spillage (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Spillage is very similar to a spillover in the physical world. Just as water spills over the edge of a container and onto the ground, information can "spill out" of its intended boundaries and onto unintended systems or individuals. This can be dangerous because it can give unauthorized individuals access to sensitive data or systems.	spillage	Explain spillage (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Spillage is much like a physical spill. For example, if you have a jug of milk and you accidentally knock it over, the milk will spread out across the surface it is on.

After penetrating the outer wall, there are successive lines of defense that an intruder must navigate before reaching their target. Each layer of security provides increasingly more protection, making it harder and harder for an unauthorized person to get what they want. Just like in real life, having multiple layers of defense makes your organization much less vulnerable to attack.	supply chain	Explain supply chain (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Supply chain (cybersecurity) can be analogized to the process of food delivery. Just as a restaurant entrusts its kitchen staff with ensuring that meals are prepared and delivered fresh to customers, organizations in the supply chain trust their suppliers to safeguard against malicious cyber activity that could impact product quality or availability. Like restaurants, supply chains operate most effectively when all members work together collaboratively towards a common goal. In order for this coordination to take place, trust and transparency are essential. When any single participant in the supply chain is compromised by cyber-attackers, it can have far-reaching consequences for everyone involved.	supply chain	Explain supply chain (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Supply chain risk management (cybersecurity) can be explained using an analogy of a castle. The walls of the castle are the supply chain and the attackers are trying to get in.

Once that's done, you can start installing windows, doors, cabinets, appliances- whatever you need to make your house complete. Throughout this entire process, it's important to stay organized and keep track of where everything goes so that when it comes time to finish up there aren't any surprises.	systems development	Explain systems development (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Systems development can be thought of as the process of creating a new system or improving an existing system. In cybersecurity, this might involve identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in systems or developing new tools and techniques to improve security. It can be a complex process, but it is essential for ensuring that our systems are safe and secure.	systems development	Explain systems development (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Systems requirements planning is like building a house. The first step is to figure out what you want your house to look like, what features it will have, and how big it needs to be. Next, you need to find a location for your house and get the necessary permits. After that, you start construction and make sure everything is up to code. Once the house is finished, you can move in!	systems requirements planning	Explain systems requirements planning (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
System requirements planning is like building a house. The first step is to lay the groundwork by marking out where the house will be and what it will look like. This is done by creating a blueprint or plan of the house. Once the foundation is in place, you can start putting up the walls and roof. In order for the house to be livable, you need to install windows, doors, plumbing, and electricity. Finally, you have to furnish and decorate the house so that it's ready for occupancy.The same basic steps are followed when planning a cybersecurity system: 1) Establish your goals and objectives 2) Identify which systems need protection 3) Create a security plan that outlines how you will protect those systems 4) Implement the security plan 5) Monitor your system for weaknesses and vulnerabilities 6) Take corrective action as needed	systems requirements planning	Explain systems requirements planning (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A systems requirements planner is like a chef. They need to understand the ingredients (systems) and what the customer wants (requirements).

A company that sells bicycles may have a system requirements planning process to ensure their website can handle the expected increase in traffic during the summer months. They would need to account for things like more people visiting the site, more orders being placed, and increased bandwidth needs. In a similar way, cybersecurity professionals plan for potential increases in cyberattacks by analyzing things like past attack data, anticipated threats, and system vulnerabilities.	systems requirements planning	Explain systems requirements planning (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Systems requirements planning (cybersecurity) is like making a cake. You have to have all the ingredients, follow the recipe, and bake it in the oven for the right amount of time. If you don’t do any of those things, your cake won’t be very good. The same is true for cybersecurity. You need to have all the right software and hardware, set it up correctly, and make sure everything is updated regularly. If you don’t do any of that, your system will be vulnerable to attack.	systems requirements planning	Explain systems requirements planning (cybersecurity) using an analogy.

Assuming that the reader has a basic understanding of systems security analysis, this section will explain it using an analogy. Systems security analysis is essentially the process of protecting a computer system from unauthorized access or use, and also from damage to or destruction of data. The first step in performing a systems security analysis is to identify the assets that need to be protected. These assets can include anything from the computer system itself, to the data that is stored on it, to the users who are authorized to access it. Once these assets have been identified, various methods can be employed to protect them. This might include installing firewalls and antivirus software, encrypting sensitive data, implementing user authentication procedures, and so on.	systems security analysis	Explain systems security analysis (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Systems security architecture can be thought of as a city’s infrastructure. Just like cities need roads, bridges, and tunnels to connect different parts of the city, computer networks need firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other security measures to protect them from attack. Similarly, just as cities have police and emergency services to respond to accidents and crime, computer networks have antivirus software and other security tools to respond to attacks.	systems security architecture	Explain systems security architecture (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Systems security architecture can be thought of as a city’s infrastructure. Just like the roads, bridges, and water system need to be well-maintained in order for a city to run smoothly, so too does a company’s cybersecurity infrastructure need to be kept up-to-date and well-protected. Otherwise, attackers could easily exploit vulnerabilities and wreak havoc on the company’s systems.	systems security architecture	Explain systems security architecture (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity system can be thought of as a building with many layers of security. The first layer is the foundation, which is made up of the basic security measures that are in place to protect the building from everyday threats such as fire and theft. The next layer is made up of additional security measures that are put in place to protect the building from more sophisticated threats, such as terrorism or cyber attacks. Finally, the top layer consists of special features that are designed to protect the most sensitive areas of the building, such as the president’s office or the data center.	systems security architecture	Explain systems security architecture (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A systems security architecture can be thought of as a city’s road map. The map details all the major roads and intersections in the city, as well as how they connect to each other. It also includes information on smaller streets and side-roads. This information is important for both drivers and city planners. Drivers need to know where they are going and how best to get there, while planners need to understand traffic patterns in order to make informed decisions about future road construction projects.In much the same way, a systems security architecture provides a blueprint for securing an organization’s computer networks. It identifies key areas of vulnerability and lays out a plan for mitigating risks. The architecture also establishes processes for detecting and responding to incidents when they do occur. Like a city’s road map, a good security architecture should be constantly updated as new threats emerge and old ones evolve	systems security architecture	Explain systems security architecture (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity can be best understood by analogy to physical security. Just as we take precautions to protect our homes and businesses from physical threats like burglary, theft, and vandalism, we need to take similar steps to secure our electronic devices and networks from cyberthreats. Security measures may include using firewalls and antivirus software, employing password protection, encrypting data, and establishing secure communications protocols.	systems security architecture	Explain systems security architecture (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Just as in a traditional tabletop exercise, players in a cybersecurity tabletop exercise are given specific roles and tasks to complete as they discuss a simulated cyber incident. The scenario is typically initiated with an overview from the game master (or "cybersecurity referee"), who provides details about the scenario including the affected networks and systems, potential attackers, and what has already been done to mitigate the situation. Players then take turns asking questions and proposing solutions, with the goal of resolving the incident in as effective and efficient a manner as possible.	tabletop exercise	Explain tabletop exercise (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A tabletop exercise is like a giant game of Risk. In this analogy, the world is the board game and each country is a player.

A tabletop exercise is a cyberattack simulation that allows organizations to test their response plans. The scenario played out during the tabletop exercise is typically based on a real-world situation, but with fictitious details to avoid compromising operational security. Participants in a tabletop exercise include decision makers from all levels of an organization, as well as representatives from business partners, law enforcement, and other agencies that may be involved in responding to a cyber incident.The goal of a tabletop exercise is to improve communication and coordination among all those involved in responding to a cybersecurity incident. By roleplaying different possible scenarios and discussing how they would respond, participants can identify areas where they need more training or better procedures.	tabletop exercise	Explain tabletop exercise (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A tabletop exercise is like a "practice" wedding. The couple gets together with their families and friends to go through the motions of what a wedding would be like. They might have a ceremony, eat dinner, and dance. But at the end of the day, it's not really real - they're just practicing for when they get married for real.In the same way, a tabletop cybersecurity exercise lets organizations practice how they would respond to a cyberattack. They can test their plans, see where their weaknesses are, and make improvements before an attack actually happens.	tabletop exercise	Explain tabletop exercise (cybersecurity) using an analogy.

A cyber security vulnerability is like a hole in your window screen. Insects can crawl through the hole and get into your house. A cyber security vulnerability lets hackers get into your computer or network and steal your data or worse.	vulnerability	Explain vulnerability (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A vulnerability in cybersecurity is like a hole in your fence. Anyone can walk right through it without having to break anything. This leaves your property (or data) susceptible to theft or damage.	vulnerability	Explain vulnerability (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A vulnerability in cybersecurity is similar to a hole in your armor. It leaves you susceptible to attack and makes it easier for someone to exploit you.	vulnerability	Explain vulnerability (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you think of a computer as a secure box, with a lock on the door, a vulnerability is like leaving the key to that lock in plain sight. That means anyone who passes by can unlock the door and potentially access whatever is inside. Cybersecurity vulnerabilities are essentially weaknesses in computer security systems that allow unauthorized access or use of data.	vulnerability	Explain vulnerability (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for vulnerability is that it is like a door that someone can walk through. If you have a lock on your door, then the person has to have the key in order to get in. However, if you do not have a lock on your door, then anyone can just walk right in.	vulnerability	Explain vulnerability (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A vulnerability assessment and management is similar to a home security system. A vulnerability assessment identifies weaknesses in the system that could be exploited by an attacker, while a management plan fixes or mitigates those weaknesses.	vulnerability assessment and management	Explain vulnerability assessment and management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity management is like a home security system. It involves using software and hardware to protect your computer or network from unauthorized access, destruction, or theft. This can be done by identifying vulnerabilities in your system and then taking steps to fix them. You can also use firewalls, anti-virus software, and other tools to help keep your system safe.	vulnerability assessment and management	Explain vulnerability assessment and management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A vulnerability assessment is like a doctor checking someone for flu symptoms. They are looking for any signs that the person might be sick so they can treat it early. A vulnerability management program is like giving everyone in your family a flu shot to prevent them from getting sick in the first place.	vulnerability assessment and management	Explain vulnerability assessment and management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is similar to a physical security assessment in that both are designed to identify and mitigate potential risks. A vulnerability assessment identifies weaknesses in systems or networks that could be exploited by attackers, while risk management involves implementing safeguards to reduce the likelihood and impact of a successful attack.	vulnerability assessment and management	Explain vulnerability assessment and management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Think of your computer as a house. Before you move in, you might do a vulnerability assessment to see if the locks on the doors are adequate, if the windows can be opened from the inside, and if there are any other ways someone could get into your house without your knowledge. You then have to decide what kind of locks to put on the doors, whether or not to install window bars, and so on. The same is true for your computer: you need to do a vulnerability assessment to see what kinds of threats are out there and how best to protect yourself against them. You may then need to install security software, change your passwords frequently, and take other steps to keep yourself safe online.	vulnerability assessment and management	Explain vulnerability assessment and management (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A cybersecurity weakness can be likened to a hole in the wall of a fortress. Attackers can find and exploit weaknesses in order to gain access to systems, data, or networks that they should not have access to.	weakness	Explain weakness (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Just as having a locked door on your house is no guarantee that you are safe from intruders, implementing cybersecurity measures such as firewalls and antivirus software is not a guarantee that your computer or network is invulnerable to attack. Like any security measure, these tools can be circumvented if an attacker is determined enough and has the necessary knowledge. Additionally, cybercriminals are constantly developing new methods of attacking systems, so it is important for organizations to continually update their security protections in order to stay ahead of these threats.	weakness	Explain weakness (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Weaknesses in cybersecurity can be compared to having a hole in your boat. Just like water can easily flow into and fill up your boat, cybercriminals can exploit vulnerabilities in order to gain access to sensitive data or infect systems with malware.	weakness	Explain weakness (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Cybersecurity is a bit like having a strong front door on your house. It keeps most people out, but if someone really wants to get in they can probably find a way. Similarly, good cybersecurity measures keep most cybercriminals at bay, but there's always the chance that one will find a way to breach your defenses and steal your data or harm your systems.	weakness	Explain weakness (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
One analogy for cybersecurity is that it is like having a strong front door on your house. A burglar can still get into your house through a window, but it will be more difficult and they are more likely to get caught. Similarly, you can have a strong password and good security software, but if you click on a link in an email from someone you don’t know or visit an infected website, your computer could be infected with malware that gives the attacker access to your data.	weakness	Explain weakness (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The white team is like the police force. They are responsible for protecting the city from criminals and ensuring the safety of the citizens. In the same way, the white team is responsible for protecting organisations from cybercrime and ensuring the safety of their employees and customers.	white team	Explain white team (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The white team (cybersecurity) is like a group of firefighters who are always prepared to put out any fires that break out. They have the latest tools and equipment, and they know how to use them effectively. They are also constantly training so that they can stay sharp and ready for anything.	white team	Explain white team (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A white team is a group of people who are brought together to test the security of a system. They try to find vulnerabilities in the system and figure out how they could be exploited. Then, they work with the developers to fix these vulnerabilities.	white team	Explain white team (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A white team is a group of people who are used to test the security of an organization's systems. They try to break into the system and find holes in the security so that the organization can fix them before someone actually does manage to hack into the system.	white team	Explain white team (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A white team is a group of people who work together to find vulnerabilities in a system and fix them. They are typically used in the cybersecurity field, but can be used in other areas as well. White teams operate much like an attack team would, attempting to break into systems and find any flaws they can exploit. Once these flaws are found, the white team works with the system's owners to fix them, making sure the system is secure from future attacks.	white team	Explain white team (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The work factor (cybersecurity) is analogous to the amount of time and effort it would take a thief to break into a locked room. The higher the work factor, the more difficult it is for someone to break into your system.	work factor	Explain work factor (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Work factor is a term used in cybersecurity to describe the amount of time or effort it would take an attacker to compromise a system. For example, if it takes an attacker 10 minutes to guess your password, then your work factor is 10. This means that the system is only as secure as your password and that the attacker could potentially gain access to your account by guessing your password multiple times.	work factor	Explain work factor (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
In cryptography, the work factor (often denoted by W) is the number of steps required to break a cryptographic algorithm. It is usually defined in terms of time taken for an attacker to mount a successful attack. For example, suppose it takes an attacker 10 minutes to break a particular algorithm. Then the work factor for that algorithm would be 10 minutes. The higher the work factor, the more secure the encryption algorithm is against attack.	work factor	Explain work factor (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If you think of your computer as a safe, the work factor is how many different combinations of numbers and letters you would have to try before you open the safe. The higher the work factor, the more difficult it is to crack the code and get into the safe.	work factor	Explain work factor (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
The work factor is a measure of the time and effort needed to break into or misuse a particular system. It can be thought of as the number of man-hours it would take an attacker to mount a successful attack. For example, if it takes 100 hours for an attacker to figure out how to exploit a vulnerability, then the work factor for that system is 100.	work factor	Explain work factor (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A worm is a type of malware that self-replicates and spreads to other systems without user intervention. It can be difficult to detect and remove. Worms are similar to viruses, but they don't require human interaction to spread.	worm	Explain worm (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Worms are like a "computer virus" on steroids! They can spread quickly and do lots of damage to your computer or network.	worm	Explain worm (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
If a worm is like a cold, then a virus would be the flu. Worms are tiny pieces of software that can spread from computer to computer through networks and damage files or programs on the computers they infect.	worm	Explain worm (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
A worm is a type of malware that can self-replicate and spread, usually through networks or email. Worms can damage files, systems, and networks, making them very disruptive and costly to organizations. Worms are often compared to viruses because they share some similar traits; however, worms are typically considered more dangerous because they can move around on their own and do not require a host file like viruses do.	worm	Explain worm (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
Worms are like tiny cyber-robots that can copy themselves and spread quickly from machine to machine. They usually enter a computer through a security hole in the software, and then take advantage of vulnerabilities to replicate and move around. Worms can cause significant damage by clogging up networks, erasing data, or even taking over machines.	worm	Explain worm (cybersecurity) using an analogy.
