An analogy to explain accuracy in machine learning is if you think of your brain as a computer, and you are trying to learn how to type. Initially, your fingers will make a lot of mistakes as they try to find the right keys. But with practice, your fingers will start making fewer mistakes until eventually you can type without looking at the keyboard.

One analogy is that bias metrics are a bit like how your bank balance affects your credit score.

The analogy of bias metric is that it is the “distance” between the predicted value and the actual value.	bias metric	What analogy is used to explain bias metric (machine learning)?
One analogy for bias is the speed of a car. Imagine you are driving down a highway and there are two lanes. The left lane is going faster than the right lane.

In this analogy, each circle represents a category, and the overlapping area between two circles represents items that fall into both categories.	categorical variables	What analogy is used to explain categorical variables (machine learning)?
The analogy that is used to explain categorical variables (machine learning) is the game of poker. In poker, there are five cards in a player's hand and each card corresponds to a particular category. For example, one card might be an Ace of Spades which would represent the "Spades" category. The other four cards might be two Queens, a Jack and a Ten which would represent the "Queen" category. There are 52 total possible cards in a deck so there are also 52 possible categories.	categorical variables	What analogy is used to explain categorical variables (machine learning)?
One analogy for categorical variables is colors. There are only a certain number of colors that can be used (red, blue, green, etc.), and these colors cannot be changed.

A human’s brain can be compared to a computer, in that both are able to store and process information. When you learn something new, your brain creates a file for that information and stores it in a specific location. A computer also works this way- when it is “trained” on data, it will create files for each piece of information and store them in specific locations.	classification	What analogy is used to explain classification (machine learning)?
A student is in a classroom. The teacher tells the student that the class is divided into two groups: those who are going to college and those who are not. The student is then placed into one of these two groups. This is an analogy for classification (machine learning).	classification	What analogy is used to explain classification (machine learning)?
One analogy to help explain machine learning and classification is the process of sorting mail. When you receive mail, it is sorted into different categories such as magazines, letters, or packages.

The analogy is used to explain that a machine learning algorithm will not learn how to distinguish between two classes of objects if the difference between these classes is too small.	classification threshold	What analogy is used to explain classification threshold (machine learning)?
One analogy is that of a door threshold. The classification threshold can be thought of as the point at which a person deciding to open a door decides whether or not to actually do so. If the weight of someone on the other side of the door exceeds the weight limit set by the threshold, then the door will be opened; if not, it will remain closed. Analogously, in machine learning, data below (or above) the classification threshold will not be used for training or testing a model.	classification threshold	What analogy is used to explain classification threshold (machine learning)?
A classification threshold is a machine learning technique that is used to determine how many features in a training set are necessary for an algorithm to be able to correctly classify new data. The analogy that is often used to explain this concept is that of a decision tree. In order for a decision tree to be able to accurately predict the outcome of a particular event, it needs enough information about the event in question. This means that there must be enough data points within the training set that fall into each category so that the decision tree can learn how to differentiate between them. If there are not enough data points within the training set, then the decision tree will not be able to accurately predict the outcome of new events.	classification threshold	What analogy is used to explain classification threshold (machine learning)?
An analogy used to explain classification threshold is that it is the point at which a machine learning algorithm decides whether to classify something as being in a particular category or not. The decision is based on how much data there is for the algorithm to analyze and how finely grained the categories are. If there isn't enough data, or if the categories are too broad, then the algorithm may not be able to make a definitive decision and may instead just return a probability that something falls into a particular category.	classification threshold	What analogy is used to explain classification threshold (machine learning)?
A classification threshold is a point at which a machine learning algorithm decides whether or not to classify an input as belonging to a certain category. This decision is often made by comparing the input against a set of pre-determined thresholds, which are used to determine how confident the machine is in its classification.	classification threshold	What analogy is used to explain classification threshold (machine learning)?
The clustering analogy compares the process of machine learning to that of humans grouping together similar items.

You are looking at the commonality between the items and grouping them accordingly.	clustering	What analogy is used to explain clustering (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain clustering is that it is like finding similar things in a pile of junk. You might find several screws together, or several pieces of paper together. This happens because these objects are near each other and have been thrown together.	clustering	What analogy is used to explain clustering (machine learning)?
A clustering algorithm is like a human being who is given a list of names and asked to group them into families. The clustering algorithm will look at the similar letters in the names and see if they form groups.	clustering	What analogy is used to explain clustering (machine learning)?
A good analogy for clustering is that it is like organizing your bedroom. You may start by sorting your clothes into piles according to type - shirts, pants, dresses, and so on. Within each pile you may then organize the clothes by color or size. Clustering works in a similar way. The computer program starts by dividing the data set into groups (clusters). It then assigns each data point to the cluster with which it has the most similarities."	clustering	What analogy is used to explain clustering (machine learning)?

The third and fourth columns contain the number of correct predictions and incorrect predictions, respectively.	confusion matrix	What analogy is used to explain confusion matrix (machine learning)?
The confusion matrix is often explained using the example of a teacher grading tests. The teacher wants to figure out how well each student understands the material, so they compare the grades on the tests with the students' true understanding of the material (based on a separate assessment). This creates a confusion matrix with four entries: correctly graded, incorrectly graded but understood, incorrectly graded and not understood, and not graded.	confusion matrix	What analogy is used to explain confusion matrix (machine learning)?

The analogy that is most often used to explain convergence is that of a student studying for an exam. The more the student studies, the better they will perform on the exam.	convergence	What analogy is used to explain convergence (machine learning)?
Convergence is often explained using the analogy of a group of people standing in a circle. The analogy assumes that each person in the circle is trying to reach the center. As more and more people try to reach the center, the overall movement of the group will gradually become faster and more directed. In other words, as people get closer to the center, they will naturally move closer to one another. This analogy can be used to explain how machine learning works.	convergence	What analogy is used to explain convergence (machine learning)?
One analogy to explain machine learning convergence is the idea of “the hundredth monkey effect”. This phenomenon suggests that if a certain critical number of monkeys learn how to wash their food, then all the other monkeys in their group will eventually also learn this behavior, without any explicit instruction from one adult monkey to another. The implication is that there is some underlying process or principle at work (in this case, observational learning) that can lead to rapid and widespread change once a tipping point is reached.	convergence	What analogy is used to explain convergence (machine learning)?
The analogy of a funnel is often used to explain the concept of convergence in machine learning. The idea is that as more data is fed into the system, its accuracy improves.	convergence	What analogy is used to explain convergence (machine learning)?
Analogy of learning a new language: A person who is trying to learn a new language does not immediately become fluent in that language. Instead, they make small steps over time until they can hold a conversation and eventually master the language.

The analogy is of a person who has been learning French for some time, and can now understand a lot of what is being said without having to think too hard. They could watch a French movie without subtitles and follow the story. The machine is like this when it learns how to recognise objects or facial features – it doesn’t have to be taught explicitly how to do this, it can work out the rules by itself from examples that are provided.	deep learning	What analogy is used to explain deep learning (machine learning)?
The deep learning analogy is often used to help explain the concept of machine learning or artificial intelligence to people who are not familiar with these ideas. Deep learning can be thought of as a way for machines to learn how to do things on their own, just like humans do. The main difference is that while humans learn from experience and observation, machines use large amounts of data that has been pre-labeled (classified) by human experts.	deep learning	What analogy is used to explain deep learning (machine learning)?
dimension is to a machine as muscles are to the human body. Just as our muscles give us the ability to interact with our environment, dimensions allow a machine learning model to “see” and understand patterns in data.	dimension	What analogy is used to explain dimension (machine learning)?
An analogy to dimension is learning in a multidimensional space. In this type of space, the location of each point is characterized by several numerical values, or dimensions. When you're dealing with data that's been "multidimensionally reduced," it means that your computer has simplified the information by reducing it down to just a few key dimensions.	dimension	What analogy is used to explain dimension (machine learning)?
When you learn a new skill – like riding a bike – you go through different dimensions. You start off by learning the basics, for example how to balance on two wheels. Once you have mastered that, you can move on to riding with traffic and eventually cycling in races. Each step along the way builds upon what you learned in the previous dimension until you reach your final goal.Machine learning works in a similar way. You start by teaching the machine how to carry out basic tasks, like identifying objects in pictures or recognizing particular words. Once it has mastered those skills, you can gradually build up its abilities so that it can carry out more complex tasks, like understanding natural language or predicting customer behavior.	dimension	What analogy is used to explain dimension (machine learning)?
Just as a 3-dimensional object occupies space in three dimensions, data in machine learning has many features (dimensions) that can be explored.	dimension	What analogy is used to explain dimension (machine learning)?

The analogy of epoch is used to explain machine learning as a process that goes through different stages, like the four seasons of the year. In the beginning, there is a lot of data that needs to be processed. This is when you are in winter and all of the data needs to be collected and sorted. Next, there is a lot of analysis and experimentation done in order to find patterns (spring). After this, you implement what you have learned (summer), and finallyevaluate how well it worked (fall).	epoch	What analogy is used to explain epoch (machine learning)?
The analogy is that epochs are like the seasons. In the summer, there is a lot of growth and new things happening. The autumn sees some of the fruits of that growth being gathered, while winter brings a time for reflection and consolidation. Spring then ushers in another round of growth.	epoch	What analogy is used to explain epoch (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain epoch is that it is like when you are learning how to drive a car. At first, everything seems new and confusing. But with practice, you start to get the hang of it.

When you first teach a child something, they do not understand everything and need help from you in order to learn. However, as time goes on, they are able to learn more on their own and eventually don't need your help as much.

Feature (machine learning) is described as a process of teaching a computer to learn on its own by recognizing patterns in data. The analogy that is often used to explain this process is that of children learning the alphabet. At first, children are taught what each letter looks like and how it is pronounced.

The size of the snowball gradually gets bigger as it rolls downhill, picking up more snow along the way. This is similar to how the gradients in a neural network are computed and accumulated over time, allowing the network to learn from data.	gradient accumulation	What analogy is used to explain gradient accumulation (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain gradient accumulation is that of a hiker ascending a mountain. The hiker takes small steps, each one slightly higher than the last, which cumulatively leads them to the summit. This is analogous to how machine learning algorithms work: they gradually learn and improve their predictions by making incremental changes (“step-by-step”), based on the data they are given.	gradient accumulation	What analogy is used to explain gradient accumulation (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is like a fitness function. The more data you feed it, the better it gets at predicting labels for new data.	gradient accumulation	What analogy is used to explain gradient accumulation (machine learning)?
Hyperparameters are similar to the knobs and dials on a machine. They are settings that you can change to affect the performance of the machine. In machine learning, hyperparameters are settings that you can change to affect the performance of a model.	hyperparameters	What analogy is used to explain hyperparameters (machine learning)?
A hyperparameter is a parameter of a machine learning algorithm that is not learned during the training process, but must be specified by the user.Just as you might fine-tune the engine of your car to get better performance, you can also fine-tune algorithms using hyperparameters. For example, if you are trying to improve the accuracy of your predictions, you might increase the number of layers in a neural network or increase the number of epochs for a gradient descent algorithm.	hyperparameters	What analogy is used to explain hyperparameters (machine learning)?
One analogy for hyperparameters is to think of them as the knobs and dials on a machine. Just like you can adjust these settings to change how a machine works, you can adjust hyperparameters to change how a machine learning algorithm performs.	hyperparameters	What analogy is used to explain hyperparameters (machine learning)?
An analogy for hyperparameters is the tuning of a piano. The strings need to be tight enough so that they produce sound, but not so tight that they snap. Similarly, the parameters of a machine learning algorithm must be tuned in order to find the best possible solution.	hyperparameters	What analogy is used to explain hyperparameters (machine learning)?
Hyperparameters are similar to knobs on a machine. They are adjustable settings that allow you to change how the machine works. In machine learning, hyperparameters control the way a model is trained and how it performs.	hyperparameters	What analogy is used to explain hyperparameters (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain induction is that it is like a vending machine. When you put in your money, the machine doesn't know what you will get, but it gives you something based on past experience.	induction	What analogy is used to explain induction (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain induction is that it is like a machine learning how to knit. The more data it has, the better it becomes at knitting.	induction	What analogy is used to explain induction (machine learning)?
The analogy of induction is often explained as learning to ride a bike. The first time you try, it may be difficult, but with practice, it becomes easier and eventually second nature. The same is true for machine learning algorithms - the more data they are exposed to, the better they become at discriminating between patterns.	induction	What analogy is used to explain induction (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain induction (machine learning) is that it is similar to the process of humans learning from experience. Just as people learn new information by observing and experiencing things in their environment, machines can also learn by processing data.	induction	What analogy is used to explain induction (machine learning)?
Analogy: In induction, the machine learning algorithm is like a teacher. The dataset is like a set of students. And the goal is for the machine learning algorithm to learn from the data and then make predictions about new data.	induction	What analogy is used to explain induction (machine learning)?
Instance is like a person’s brain. It is constantly learning and trying to find patterns in the data it is given.	instance	What analogy is used to explain instance (machine learning)?
Instance is a form of machine learning where patterns are discovered in data. It is similar to pattern recognition, where a computer program is taught how to recognize certain patterns. However, with instance, the program is not told what specific patterns to look for, but instead it looks at all the data and discovers its own patterns.	instance	What analogy is used to explain instance (machine learning)?
Instance is used in a similar way to how one would think of an object. In machine learning, instances are the data that is being used to train a model. So for example, if you were trying to create a model to predict whether or not someone will default on their loan, you would use historical data about people who have defaulted on loans in the past as your instances.	instance	What analogy is used to explain instance (machine learning)?
Instance is used to explain machine learning in the same way that a person can learn from experience. When a person learns, they remember and apply what they have learned in new situations. Machine learning works in a similar way. Machines “learn” by processing large amounts of data and then using algorithms to identify patterns. The machines can then use these patterns to make predictions or decisions in new situations.	instance	What analogy is used to explain instance (machine learning)?
Instance is like a person. A person can be taught to do things, and they can learn on their own by observing other people. An instance in machine learning works the same way.	instance	What analogy is used to explain instance (machine learning)?
Labeling is like putting a name tag on somebody. It tells us who that person is. In machine learning, labels are used to identify and group similar objects together.	label	What analogy is used to explain label (machine learning)?
Labeling data as input is like naming the colors of all the objects in a room. You are not learning anything about the objects themselves, but you are preparing yourself to learn something by providing a frame of reference for future study.	label	What analogy is used to explain label (machine learning)?
Label is machine learning can be described as the process of teaching a computer to learn how to identify objects or patterns in data, without being explicitly programmed.	label	What analogy is used to explain label (machine learning)?
Labeling is similar to teaching a computer how to identify images of different objects. First, you show the computer many examples of each kind of object - for example, pictures of dogs and cats. Then, you “teach” the computer how to identify each object by giving it a label, or name. After that, the computer can look at any picture and tell you what animal is in it - even if it’s never seen that exact picture before.	label	What analogy is used to explain label (machine learning)?
Labeling is like putting a name tag on a person.	label	What analogy is used to explain label (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain learning rate is that it is like a person's ability to learn new things. The faster someone can learn, the higher their learning rate will be.	learning rate	What analogy is used to explain learning rate (machine learning)?
The analogy of learning rate is that it is like the speed at which a person learns a new skill. The faster someone learns, the more they can improve their skills over time.	learning rate	What analogy is used to explain learning rate (machine learning)?
The rate at which a machine learning algorithm learns can be metaphorically thought of as the speed at which it acquires new information. Just as our brains learn and retain knowledge at different rates, so too do different algorithms vary in their ability to absorb and remember new information.	learning rate	What analogy is used to explain learning rate (machine learning)?
A learning rate can be thought of as the speed at which a machine learning algorithm learns. It is usually measured in terms of the number of correct classifications made per unit time.	learning rate	What analogy is used to explain learning rate (machine learning)?
The analogy is that the learning rate is like a gas pedal. The harder you press on it, the faster the car goes.	learning rate	What analogy is used to explain learning rate (machine learning)?
A common analogy used to explain loss in machine learning is that of a teacher and student. The teacher represents the computer, while the student represents the human. The goal of the teacher is to help the student learn as much as possible, while minimizing losses (errors).	loss	What analogy is used to explain loss (machine learning)?
Loss is often explained using the analogy of a machine learning algorithm being like a puppy. A puppy is initially excited and enthusiastic about everything it encounters, but as it gets older it begins to learn which things are dangerous and which are not. The puppy gradually loses its initial enthusiasm for new things as it becomes more knowledgeable.	loss	What analogy is used to explain loss (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a black box. We put data in the top, and hopefully we get insights or predictions out the bottom. But what happens inside the black box? We don’t always know. Just like when you lose something important, like your car keys, you might spend hours searching for them under couch cushions and inside drawers but ultimately never find them, with machine learning we may never know why our model made a particular prediction.	loss	What analogy is used to explain loss (machine learning)?
Loss is commonly explained in the context of machine learning as being similar to a student's score on a quiz. A low score would represent a loss for the student, while a high score would represent a gain. In the same way, lower Loss values in machine learning algorithms indicate that the algorithm is doing better at minimizing incorrect predictions, or "loss."	loss	What analogy is used to explain loss (machine learning)?
A common analogy used to explain loss in machine learning is that of a person's weight. In the beginning, when someone starts a diet and exercise program, they might lose a lot of weight very quickly. However, as time goes on and they get closer to their goal weight, the rate at which they lose weight will slow down. This is because their body has already burned off most of the easy-to-lose fat and now it is burning muscle mass (which takes more time and effort). The same phenomenon occurs in machine learning; early on in the training process, there is a large amount of loss (i.e., the model is making many mistakes), but as it gets closer to achieving its goal (i.e., accurately predicting labels), the amount of loss decreases.	loss	What analogy is used to explain loss (machine learning)?
Some people think of machine learning as a “black box” where you put in data and the computer somehow figures out how to learn from it. Others view machine learning as decision trees: you can see what inputs go into making a decision, but not necessarily how the computer arrives at its conclusions.	machine learning	What analogy is used to explain machine learning (machine learning)?
A learning machine is a system that improves its performance over time, through experience. The term “machine learning” was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an American computer scientist who developed one of the first successful self-learning algorithms for playing checkers.	machine learning	What analogy is used to explain machine learning (machine learning)?
Analogy: Machine learning is like teaching a computer to play chess. At first, the computer doesn't know how to play at all. But, you can give it some basic rules and then let it learn from experience. The more games it plays, the better it will get at playing chess.	machine learning	What analogy is used to explain machine learning (machine learning)?
machine learning is like a child that is constantly being taught, and getting better over time at understanding new things	machine learning	What analogy is used to explain machine learning (machine learning)?
A computer is like a baby. At first, it knows nothing. But with enough data and experience, it can learn to do amazing things.	machine learning	What analogy is used to explain machine learning (machine learning)?
A model is a machine learning algorithm that has been trained on data. The analogy that is often used to explain how models work is that of a map. A map represents the real world in a simplified way. It can be used to find directions from one place to another, or to plan a route for travelling between two points.	model	What analogy is used to explain model (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain machine learning is that it is similar to humans learning from experience. Just as people learn how to do things by doing them and observing the results, so too can machines learn how to do things given enough data and examples.	model	What analogy is used to explain model (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain machine learning is that of a person’s brain. Just as the human brain learns and stores new information over time, so does a machine learning algorithm. With experience, both the brain and the machine learning algorithm get better at recognizing patterns and making predictions.	model	What analogy is used to explain model (machine learning)?
The analogy of a model is that of a machine learning. Just as a machine can be taught to do certain tasks through repetition and practice, so too can a model be “trained” on data in order to learn how to recognize patterns and make predictions.	model	What analogy is used to explain model (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain machine learning is that it can be thought of as a “machine” that can learn on its own by observing patterns in data. Just like humans, this machine can get better over time at recognizing patterns and making predictions based on what it has learned.	model	What analogy is used to explain model (machine learning)?
A neural network is a bit like the human brain. It can learn how to do things by itself, just like we can.	neural networks	What analogy is used to explain neural networks (machine learning)?
A neural network is a bit like the human brain. We have lots of individual cells, called neurons, and each neuron can talk to some other neurons. When we learn something new, for example how to ride a bike, our brain creates new connections between its neurons. This lets us store the information about riding a bike in our brains so that we can do it again next time we try.A neural network works in much the same way. It has lots of little processing units, called nodes, and each node can talk to some other nodes. When it learns something new, for example how to recognise an object in a picture, it creates new connections between its nodes. This lets it store the information about recognising objects in pictures so that it can do it again next time it sees one.	neural networks	What analogy is used to explain neural networks (machine learning)?
A good analogy to neural networks is the human brain. Our brains contain a large number of interconnected neurons, which can process information and learn from experience. Similarly, a neural network consists of a large number of interconnected processing nodes, which can process information and learn from experience.	neural networks	What analogy is used to explain neural networks (machine learning)?
A neural network is a bit like the human brain. It can learn how to do things by itself, and it gets better at doing them over time.	neural networks	What analogy is used to explain neural networks (machine learning)?
ML is often thought of as being similar to the brain. The brain has a vast network of interconnected neurons, and each neuron can interact with many other neurons. This network enables the brain to learn and recognize patterns. Similarly, ML algorithms are composed of a large number of interconnected nodes (or "brain cells"), and each node can process information from multiple data points. This allows ML algorithms to learn and recognize patterns in data.	neural networks	What analogy is used to explain neural networks (machine learning)?
One analogy to think of when considering normalization in machine learning is with the scaling of equations in mathematics. Think about the equation x = 2. If you were to graph this equation, it would look like a line that crosses the y-axis at point (0,2). However, if you multiply all values within the equation by 10, then the equation becomes x = 20. Now if you graph this new equation, it will look like a line that crosses the y-axis at point (10,20). The important thing here is that both equations still represent the same linear relationship between x and y; only the scale has changed. Normalizing your data sets can be thought of in a similar way. You are essentially rescaling your data so that all values lie within a certain range (most commonly 0 to 1), which makes comparisons between different data sets more accurate and meaningful.	normalization	What analogy is used to explain normalization (machine learning)?
Normalization is a technique used in machine learning to make sure that the features of different instances of a data set are on the same scale. This allows for more accurate comparisons between instances and makes it easier to find patterns in the data. An analogy for normalization might be making all students take a standardized test so that their scores can be accurately compared.	normalization	What analogy is used to explain normalization (machine learning)?
Similar to the way humans learn new things over time, normalization is a machine learning technique that helps a computer system become better at recognizing patterns and identifying objects. Normalization adjusts numerical values so that they are all within a certain range. By doing this, it becomes easier for the computer system to identify similarities and differences among data sets.	normalization	What analogy is used to explain normalization (machine learning)?
One analogy for normalization is that it is like taking a bath. Just as you would not want to be covered in dirt and grime when you get out of the bath, you do not want your features to be too high or low relative to one another after normalization. By bringing all the features up or down to the same scale, we can better compare them and learn from them.	normalization	What analogy is used to explain normalization (machine learning)?
One analogy to normalization is the process of ironing clothes. Ironing makes the fabric smoother and less wrinkled. In a similar way, normalizing a dataset makes all of the features in the data have roughly the same range.	normalization	What analogy is used to explain normalization (machine learning)?
Noise is like a baby crying in an otherwise silent room. It's difficult to focus on anything else when there's a lot of noise going on. In the same way, it can be difficult to focus on anything else when there's a lot of noise (random data) in your machine learning dataset.	noise	What analogy is used to explain noise (machine learning)?
Noise is often described as "the fuzz" or "the noise of the world." It's a term that we use to describe everything from the sound of traffic outside our window to the chatter of people in a crowded room. In many ways, it's an unavoidable part of life. machine learning is similar in that it's an essential process for making sense of data, but it can also be overwhelming and difficult to understand at times.	noise	What analogy is used to explain noise (machine learning)?
The analogy of noise in machine learning is the same as when you are trying to have a conversation in a room with people talking. If there is too much noise, it becomes hard to carry on a conversation. The same happens with machine learning when there is too much data and not enough labeling/structure. It becomes difficult for the algorithm to learn effectively.	noise	What analogy is used to explain noise (machine learning)?
Machine learning is like a cocktail party. You hear a lot of different voices, but you’re not always sure who is saying what. With machine learning, you are trying to identify patterns in data so that you can make predictions or decisions.	noise	What analogy is used to explain noise (machine learning)?
The machine learning analogy is often used to explain the concept of noise in a way that is easy for beginners to understand. Noise can be thought of as random errors or fluctuations in the data that can obscure or degrade the accuracy of predictions made by a machine learning algorithm. Just like in real life, noise can cause problems when trying to make decisions based on information received from noisy sources.	noise	What analogy is used to explain noise (machine learning)?
A null accuracy machine learning analogy would be to say that the machine is as accurate as flipping a coin. The machine has a 50% chance of being correct no matter what it predicts.	null accuracy	What analogy is used to explain null accuracy (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain null accuracy is that it is like a person guessing the answer to a question. If they guess, there is a 50% chance of them being correct. If they do not know the answer, there is still a 50% chance of them being correct.	null accuracy	What analogy is used to explain null accuracy (machine learning)?
The analogy is of a person who is trying to learn about a particular topic, for example cars. They read articles and watch videos on cars but still might not be able to identify different models or brands when they see them. The person has null accuracy because they have learned nothing about cars from their sources.	null accuracy	What analogy is used to explain null accuracy (machine learning)?
A null accuracy analogy can be described as if a person is searching for a needle in a haystack. Even if the needle was found, there’s no guarantee it would be accurate.	null accuracy	What analogy is used to explain null accuracy (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain null accuracy is that of a person trying to shoot arrows at a target. If the person misses the target every time, their accuracy would be said to be null.	null accuracy	What analogy is used to explain null accuracy (machine learning)?
The analogy of an observation is being like a student in school. The more the student observes, the more they learn.	observation	What analogy is used to explain observation (machine learning)?
Observation is like a machine learning algorithm that has been trained on a set of data. It can then be used to make predictions about new data that it has not seen before.	observation	What analogy is used to explain observation (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain observation (machine learning) is that it is similar to a child learning how to speak. A child hears people speaking and gradually learns the words and grammar rules. With enough exposure, they can eventually speak the language fluently.	observation	What analogy is used to explain observation (machine learning)?
Observation is related to the idea of learning from data. In machine learning, we are typically interested in building a model from a set of training data and then using that model to make predictions on new data. We can think of this as being similar to how humans learn from experience. For example, when you first learned how to ride a bike, you probably needed lots of practice (i.e., observations). After practicing for a while, you gradually got better at it and could eventually ride without thinking about it too much. This is analogous to how machine learning models learn: by ingesting large amounts of data and improving over time through repeated exposure (or “training”).	observation	What analogy is used to explain observation (machine learning)?
Analogy: Learning to ride a bike. At first it is difficult, but with practice it becomes easier.	observation	What analogy is used to explain observation (machine learning)?
In machine learning, an outlier is an observation point that doesn’t fit the general trend of the data. It can be thought of as a data point that is far away from the rest of the data points in a dataset. Outliers can occur due to sampling errors or because some unusual event has occurred.	outlier	What analogy is used to explain outlier (machine learning)?
An analogy used to explain outlier (machine learning) is that outliers are like passengers on a bus. The other passengers, who represent the majority of people on the bus, can be thought of as representing the data set. The outliers are those people who don’t quite fit in with the rest of the group and stand out from them. In terms of machine learning, these outliers represent unusual or unexpected data points that don’t necessarily follow the trend or pattern observed in the rest of the dataset.	outlier	What analogy is used to explain outlier (machine learning)?
An analogy to help explain outlier is the example of a student who is a standout in one subject but not so much in others. This student would be considered an outlier in terms of their academic performance when compared to classmates. In machine learning, an outlier is a data point that doesn't fit with the rest of the data set and has been flagged for further investigation.	outlier	What analogy is used to explain outlier (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy to outliers is the use of "Noise" in a signal. In most cases, outliers are due to some kind of noise (random fluctuations) superimposed on the true pattern that we are trying to detect. We can often eliminate noise by applying a filter or by increasing the sample size.	outlier	What analogy is used to explain outlier (machine learning)?
A computer is like a brain. It can be taught to recognize patterns in data, and then predict outcomes based on those patterns. An outlier is something that doesn't fit the pattern that the computer has been taught to recognize.	outlier	What analogy is used to explain outlier (machine learning)?
The analogy of overfitting is that it is the machine learning equivalent of training a dog to recognize only one person. The dog will be able to perfectly identify that one person, but if presented with anyone else, the dog will have no idea who they are.	overfitting	What analogy is used to explain overfitting (machine learning)?
Excessive amounts of data can be as damaging to machine learning models as a lack of data. A model that has been “overfit” to its training data will perform poorly on new, unseen data. This is because the model has become so specialized in modeling the quirks of the specific training set that it fails to generalize well to other datasets. An analogy for overfitting might be a student who memorizes all the questions and answers on one test and then does poorly on similar tests.	overfitting	What analogy is used to explain overfitting (machine learning)?
It is often said that a “machine learning algorithm overfits the data when it has been trained on too many specific examples and begins to make inaccurate predictions for new data”. This analogy can be used to help explain what overfitting is and how it can occur during machine learning. For example, imagine you are trying to teach someone how to play tennis. If you only give them one or two specific examples of how to hit a ball, they will likely be able to replicate those swings perfectly. However, if you ask them to play in an actual match against another person, their performance will likely be quite poor because they have not learned all the different ways that balls can be hit. In a similar way, machine learning algorithms can overfit the data if they are only trained on a limited number of examples. This can lead to inaccurate predictions for new data sets.	overfitting	What analogy is used to explain overfitting (machine learning)?
Overfitting is like when you learn a new word, but then start using it in every sentence. You know the word perfectly, but everyone else just thinks you’re strange.	overfitting	What analogy is used to explain overfitting (machine learning)?
A common analogy for overfitting is to imagine that you are a very good tailor who can make a suit that fits your customer perfectly. However, if the customer keeps gaining weight, the suit will soon be too tight and no longer fit well. The tailor has made too much of a perfect fit for this individual customer and therefore cannot easily adjust to future changes in size. This is analogous to what can happen when you have a machine learning model that is “overfit” on your data set – it can accurately predict patterns within the training data but may not be able to generalize well to new or unseen data.	overfitting	What analogy is used to explain overfitting (machine learning)?
Parameters in machine learning are like the knobs and levers on a guitar. They allow you to adjust how the instrument behaves, so that you can get the sound that you want. In the same way, parameters in machine learning allow you to tweak how your model works, so that it achieves the desired results.	parameters	What analogy is used to explain parameters (machine learning)?
Parameters are similar to the knobs and dials on a machine. By turning them, you can change how the machine behaves. In the same way, by adjusting the parameters of a machine learning algorithm, you can control how it learns from data.	parameters	What analogy is used to explain parameters (machine learning)?
Parameters are like the knobs and levers on a machine. They allow you to control how the machine works. In machine learning, parameters allow you to control how your model behaves.	parameters	What analogy is used to explain parameters (machine learning)?
A machine learning parameter can be thought of as a knob on a washing machine. Turning the knob changes how the washing machine operates, similarly, adjusting a parameter in machine learning alters how the model learns and performs.	parameters	What analogy is used to explain parameters (machine learning)?
An analogy used to explain parameters (machine learning) is that they are like the dials on a stereo. Just as you can turn the dials to change the sound, you can tweak the parameters of a machine learning algorithm to adjust its behavior.	parameters	What analogy is used to explain parameters (machine learning)?
Precision is a measure of how often a machine learning algorithm correctly identifies the correct target value for a given input. It is usually measured as a percentage, and can be computed using the following equation: Precision = (Number of True Positives) / (Number of True Positives + Number of False Negatives)	precision	What analogy is used to explain precision (machine learning)?
A common analogy for precision is that of a high-precision rifle. Just as a rifle must be precisely calibrated in order to hit a target, machine learning algorithms must be finely tuned in order to produce accurate results.	precision	What analogy is used to explain precision (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be compared to a person who has been taught how to accurately throw darts. The more darts the person throws, the better their aim becomes. The same is true for machine learning algorithms; as they are exposed to more data, they become better at discriminating between different patterns.	precision	What analogy is used to explain precision (machine learning)?
Precision is often explained using the analogy of a microscope. Just as a microscope can make small objects appear larger, precision in machine learning makes small differences between data points appear greater.	precision	What analogy is used to explain precision (machine learning)?
Precision is the ability of a machine learning model to identify the correct target variable when it is included in the training set. It is often expressed as a percentage, and indicates how frequently the target variable was correctly identified among all predictions made by the model.	precision	What analogy is used to explain precision (machine learning)?
Recall is often explained using the analogy of a person learning new information. When someone first learns about something, they are likely to remember only a small amount of what was covered. However, as they continue to learn more about the topic, they will be able to recall more and more information. The same principle applies when machines are taught how to recognize patterns: at first they may only be able to identify a few examples but with further training they will become better at detecting patterns and recalling associated information.	recall	What analogy is used to explain recall (machine learning)?
The analogy of recall is that it is like a person being able to remember what they learned in school. It is the ability for the machine learning algorithm to be able to find and remember patterns in data.	recall	What analogy is used to explain recall (machine learning)?
Recall (machine learning) is often described as a machine "learning" how to recognize patterns in data. Just as you might teach a child how to identify different types of animals by pointing out specific characteristics (e.g., furry, four legs, barks), a machine learning algorithm can be “trained” to recognize certain patterns in data. The more data the algorithm “sees,” the better it gets at identifying those patterns.	recall	What analogy is used to explain recall (machine learning)?
The analogy is used to explain how the machine learning algorithm works. The recall algorithm is like a person's memory. The more information that is fed into the system, the better it becomes at distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant information.	recall	What analogy is used to explain recall (machine learning)?
Recall is machine learning term used to describe the ability of a computer system to remember and learn from past experiences. This analogy can be thought of as a human's brain being able to remember things from the past and using that knowledge in the present.	recall	What analogy is used to explain recall (machine learning)?
A scientist may remember a certain fact with high precision, but recall it imperfectly. A machine learning algorithm might be able to perfectly recall a set of data, but not have a very high precision.	recall vs precision	What analogy is used to explain recall vs precision (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm tries to approximate a function, and recall is how accurately the approximation reproduces the input data. Precision is how often the approximation produces a result that matches the desired output.	recall vs precision	What analogy is used to explain recall vs precision (machine learning)?
A recall of 0.5 means that the machine has predicted 50% of the instances correctly, whereas a precision of 0.5 means that the machine has only predicted 50% of the positive instances correctly.	recall vs precision	What analogy is used to explain recall vs precision (machine learning)?
The analogy is that recall is the rate of how often you are able to find an item in a list, while precision is how accurately you are able to identify the item when it is found.	recall vs precision	What analogy is used to explain recall vs precision (machine learning)?
Recall is the number of relevant items found in a search, divided by the total number of items found. Precision is the number of correct hits divided by the total number of items returned (relevant and irrelevant).	recall vs precision	What analogy is used to explain recall vs precision (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain regression is that it is similar to predicting someone's future income based on their current income.	regression	What analogy is used to explain regression (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is like a recipe. You give it some data (the ingredients) and it produces a prediction or output (a cake). The better the recipe, the more accurate the cake will be.	regression	What analogy is used to explain regression (machine learning)?
A regression analogy is used to explain machine learning as the process of estimating or predicting a future value for a particular output variable (Y) based on one or more input variables (X). In other words, it can be thought of as using past data to predict future outcomes.	regression	What analogy is used to explain regression (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a function that takes in an input (a set of training data) and outputs a prediction. The prediction is based on the information contained in the training data, as well as the parameters of the machine learning algorithm.	regression	What analogy is used to explain regression (machine learning)?
Analogy: Learning to ride a bike. You keep practicing until you can do it without thinking about it.	regression	What analogy is used to explain regression (machine learning)?
A regularization analogy in machine learning is the use of a "spanning tree" to guide the placement of electrical wires. A spanning tree is a special type of graph that connects all the points in a network without any branches or loops. In other words, it's like a map of all the connections between nodes.	regularization	What analogy is used to explain regularization (machine learning)?
Regularization can be thought of as a type of optimization problem. The goal is to find the best possible set of weights for a model that minimizes some measure of error, while also satisfying certain constraints.	regularization	What analogy is used to explain regularization (machine learning)?
An analogy to regularization in machine learning is weight training for athletes. In order to build muscle, you need to put stress on your muscles by lifting weights. However, if you lift too much weight, you can injure yourself. To avoid injury, you need to add some extra weight (the regularization term) so that the muscle-building process is slowed down a bit.	regularization	What analogy is used to explain regularization (machine learning)?
An analogy that is often used to explain regularization in machine learning is the process of seasoning a new piece of wood. When you first get a piece of wood, it is quite dry and difficult to work with. However, if you put it in water and let it soak for a while, then it will become much easier to manipulate. In the same way, when you first train a machine learning model on some data, it may be very inaccurate because the data is quite unbalanced. However, by using regularization techniques such as shrinkage or weight decay, you can make the model more accurate by penalizing its complexity.	regularization	What analogy is used to explain regularization (machine learning)?
A machine learning regularization analogy could involve a sculptor. When creating a sculpture, the sculptor may need to add clay to some parts of the sculpture and remove clay from other parts in order to create the desired shape. In the same way, when training a machine learning model, we may need to add or subtract some data points (i.e., “clay”) in order to improve the accuracy of the model.	regularization	What analogy is used to explain regularization (machine learning)?
Analogy: Learning to ride a bike.	reinforcement learning	What analogy is used to explain reinforcement learning (machine learning)?
Reinforcement learning is comparable to the way a baby learns. The baby observes what actions result in which outcomes, and then adjusts its own behavior accordingly.	reinforcement learning	What analogy is used to explain reinforcement learning (machine learning)?
An analogy used to explain reinforcement learning is that it is like training a dog. The dog is given a treat (reinforcement) when it performs a desired behavior, such as sitting politely. Overtime, the dog learns to sit politely not just because it wants a treat but also because it knows that this action will lead to positive outcomes (e.g., being petted or praised).	reinforcement learning	What analogy is used to explain reinforcement learning (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain reinforcement learning is that it is like a baby learning how to walk. The baby keeps trying new things until it finds something that works, and then it will do that thing more often.	reinforcement learning	What analogy is used to explain reinforcement learning (machine learning)?
Reinforcement learning is like a baby learning how to walk. The baby tries different things - some work, some don't. When the baby does something that leads to getting closer to walking, it gets a 'reward' (like being praised or given a toy). This encourages the baby to do more of those things in the future. With enough practice, the baby will eventually learn how to walk	reinforcement learning	What analogy is used to explain reinforcement learning (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain Roc curve is that it is like a teacher. The more data the teacher has, the better they are able to predict how their students will do in the future.	roc curve	What analogy is used to explain roc curve (machine learning)?
The analogy of roc curve is the use of a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve in machine learning. A ROC curve is a graphical representation of the performance of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The true positive rate (TPR) is plotted against the false positive rate (FPR).	roc curve	What analogy is used to explain roc curve (machine learning)?
Roc curve is a graphical representation of the performance of a machine learning algorithm. The x-axis represents the proportion of correct predictions made by the algorithm, and the y-axis represents the number of incorrect predictions. The roc curve typically takes on a U-shape, with a steep decline in accuracy as the percentage of incorrect predictions increases.	roc curve	What analogy is used to explain roc curve (machine learning)?
Roc curve is the graphical representation of a machine learning algorithm’s performance on training data. The x-axis represents the fraction of test data instances that are correctly classified by the model and the y-axis represents the number of instances in total.	roc curve	What analogy is used to explain roc curve (machine learning)?
Roc curve is similar to the graph of a function in mathematics. The x-axis represents the number of correct predictions made by the machine learning algorithm, while the y-axis corresponds to how often that prediction was actually made.	roc curve	What analogy is used to explain roc curve (machine learning)?
Segmentation is similar to the process of a human brain learning how to recognize objects. In segmentation, a computer program breaks an image or other data into small pieces called segments. The purpose of segmenting data is to make it easier for a computer program to understand and analyze it.	segmentation	What analogy is used to explain segmentation (machine learning)?
A way to think of segmentation is as the process of dividing a big pile of data into smaller piles, or segments. Each pile is then analyzed separately to see if it has any common characteristics. After that, the analyst can decide what group each individual piece of data belongs in.	segmentation	What analogy is used to explain segmentation (machine learning)?
Segmentation is the process of dividing a population into homogeneous subgroups. The analogy used to explain it is that of splitting an ocean into different parts based on its water temperature.	segmentation	What analogy is used to explain segmentation (machine learning)?
Segmentation is often compared to splitting an orange into segments. Each segment represents a different layer in the machine learning model.	segmentation	What analogy is used to explain segmentation (machine learning)?
Segmentation is like a human being learning how to identify objects in their environment. In the beginning, they are presented with a few simple examples (a ball, a cat), and then they generalize from these examples to more complex ones (a soccer ball, a tabby cat). Similarly, machine learning algorithms start by being trained on a small number of data points, and then they can be generalized to apply to new data sets.	segmentation	What analogy is used to explain segmentation (machine learning)?
The analogy of specificity is that of a machine learning. Just as a machine can be trained to carry out specific tasks by being exposed to specific data, so too can the human brain be conditioned to recognize patterns and make distinctions by being exposed to similar data.	specificity	What analogy is used to explain specificity (machine learning)?
An analogy that is often used to explain specificity in machine learning is to think of a person’s face. When you see a person’s face for the first time, you may not be able to recognize them, but after seeing their face multiple times, you will start to recognize them. This is because your brain has become specific to the features of that person’s face. The more faces you see, the better your brain becomes at recognizing those faces.	specificity	What analogy is used to explain specificity (machine learning)?
A person who has never ridden a bike might not be able to ride a unicycle. The person would need to learn how the different mechanisms of balance work on each type of vehicle before being able to successfully ride them.	specificity	What analogy is used to explain specificity (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain specificity in machine learning is that of a person reading a map. The person needs to be familiar with the specific area they are navigating in order to find their way. Similarly, in machine learning, a model needs to be trained on a specific dataset so that it can accurately classify new data.	specificity	What analogy is used to explain specificity (machine learning)?
The analogy that is often used to explain specificity in machine learning is that of a person being able to recognize their friends' faces. Even if two people have different hairstyles, or are wearing sunglasses, the person will still be able torecognize their friends' faces. This is because the person has specific knowledge about which features (e.g., hair color, eye color) are important for identifying their friends. In the same way, a machine learning algorithm can be taught to recognize certain patterns in data (e.g., email addresses, social media posts).	specificity	What analogy is used to explain specificity (machine learning)?

The students are given feedback on their work which allows them to learn and improve over time.	supervised learning	What analogy is used to explain supervised learning (machine learning)?
Supervised learning is similar to teaching a child how to read. A human teacher provides feedback (supervision) to the child as they learn, correcting them when they make mistakes and helping them along the way. In supervised learning, a computer system also learns from feedback provided by humans, gradually improving its ability to perform certain tasks.	supervised learning	What analogy is used to explain supervised learning (machine learning)?
Supervised learning is similar to being taught in a classroom. A teacher provides input (examples) and feedback (correct answers), allowing the student to learn and eventually generalize from the examples.	supervised learning	What analogy is used to explain supervised learning (machine learning)?

A test set allows you to see how well your machine learning algorithm is performing on data that it has not seen before.	test set	What analogy is used to explain test set (machine learning)?
A test set is used to measure how well a machine learning algorithm can generalize from training data to new data. It is similar to how athletes use practice drills to improve their performance in an actual game.	test set	What analogy is used to explain test set (machine learning)?
A test set is a group of items or examples that are used to evaluate the accuracy of a machine learning model. The test set is separate from the training set, which is used to teach the machine learning model how to recognize patterns.	test set	What analogy is used to explain test set (machine learning)?
A test set is a machine learning technique used to measure the accuracy of a model. It is usually composed of data that was not used to train the model, and it is used to evaluate how well the model can predict new data.	test set	What analogy is used to explain test set (machine learning)?
One analogy is that a test set is like a map. A machine learning algorithm can use the training data to learn how to navigate from point A to point B, and then use the test set to check its accuracy by seeing if it can find the correct path in the testing set.	test set	What analogy is used to explain test set (machine learning)?
A training set is like a teacher. The teacher knows a lot about the subject and can teach you what you need to know. The teacher will also give you homework so that you can learn more on your own.	training set	What analogy is used to explain training set (machine learning)?
A training set is a group of data that is used to teach a machine how to perform a specific task. The machine learning algorithm uses this data to learn the patterns and relationships between the input and output values. Once it has learned these patterns, it can then apply them to new data in order to generate predictions.	training set	What analogy is used to explain training set (machine learning)?
A training set is a collection of data used to train a machine learning algorithm. The purpose of the training set is to help the algorithm learn how to recognize patterns in data.	training set	What analogy is used to explain training set (machine learning)?

A training set is like a teacher. The teacher explains the material to the student and provides examples to help them learn. Then, the student uses what they learned from the teacher to solve problems on their own. In machine learning, a training set is used to teach a computer how to recognize patterns in data.	training set	What analogy is used to explain training set (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy that is often used to explain transfer learning is the way humans learn. When a child is first born, they do not know how to speak any language. However, through exposure to different languages and being around people who speak those languages, the child begins to pick up certain words and phrases. After a while, the child can start speaking those languages fluently. This is an example of transfer learning because the child has learned how to speak multiple languages by using information from previous experiences (exposure to other languages).	transfer learning	What analogy is used to explain transfer learning (machine learning)?
Machine learning can be thought of as a process of transferring knowledge from a source domain or task to a target domain. For example, you might use machine learning to transfer the skills you learned in playing chess to the game of checkers.	transfer learning	What analogy is used to explain transfer learning (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a model building tool. The first time you use it, the algorithm is likely to perform poorly on the training data. However, if you take the time to “teach” the algorithm how to recognize features in your data by adjusting its internal settings, it will be able to generalize well to new data sets.	transfer learning	What analogy is used to explain transfer learning (machine learning)?
One analogy for transfer learning is that it is like teaching a second language. When you first learn a new language, it can be difficult to understand and speak correctly. However, after you have learned a few basic phrases and words, it becomes much easier to learn more complex concepts in the new language because you already have some understanding of how it works. The same principle applies to machine learning; if you can train a machine learning algorithm on a dataset with similar characteristics to the one you want to use it on, it will be much easier for the algorithm to learn and perform well on the new dataset.	transfer learning	What analogy is used to explain transfer learning (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy that is often used to explain transfer learning is the way humans learn. When a baby learns how to speak, they do not start by memorizing every word in every language. Instead, they learn how to speak their native language by listening to people around them and gradually picking up on the words and phrases that are used most frequently. Once they have learned the basics of their native language, they can then start trying to learn new languages by using what they already know about speaking to help them understand the new language. This is similar to how transfer learning works in machine learning; instead of starting from scratch each time a new task is learned, it builds on knowledge that was acquired while working on previous tasks.	transfer learning	What analogy is used to explain transfer learning (machine learning)?
The analogy of a true positive rate is when you are pregnant and the doctor tells you that you are. It's like a 100% certainty.	true positive rate	What analogy is used to explain true positive rate (machine learning)?
The analogy is that of a person flipping a coin. If the person flips the coin and it lands on heads, then they would say that the true positive rate is 50%.	true positive rate	What analogy is used to explain true positive rate (machine learning)?
A true positive rate is a measure of how often a machine learning algorithm correctly identifies instances it has been trained to identify, also called the recall rate. An analogy for this could be someone who is trying to find their lost phone. If they have an app that was specifically designed to help them find their phone, and they use it regularly, then the true positive rate for that app would be high. Conversely, if they never use the app or only use it once in a while, then the true positive rate would be lower.	true positive rate	What analogy is used to explain true positive rate (machine learning)?
The analogy to explain true positive rate is that it is like a person flipping a coin and getting heads every time. It is 100% because they are always getting the result that they want.	true positive rate	What analogy is used to explain true positive rate (machine learning)?
A true positive rate is used to describe how accurate a machine learning algorithm is. It is calculated by dividing the number of actual positives that were correctly identified by the total number of actual positives and negatives.	true positive rate	What analogy is used to explain true positive rate (machine learning)?
Type 1 error is the equivalent of a false positive in medical testing. A type 1 error occurs when a machine learning algorithm incorrectly identifies a pattern in data as being statistically significant, when it is not.	type 1 error	What analogy is used to explain type 1 error (machine learning)?
Type 1 error is the equivalent of a false positive in medical testing. In both cases, the result suggests that something is present when it is not.	type 1 error	What analogy is used to explain type 1 error (machine learning)?
When you're flipping through TV channels and stop on one that's not your favorite show, type 1 error would be equivalent to stopping on a channel that's actually broadcasting your favorite show but thinking it's not.	type 1 error	What analogy is used to explain type 1 error (machine learning)?
Type 1 error is often compared to a person being falsely accused of a crime. Just as the person may spend time in jail despite being innocent, data may be "convicted" of a mistake even though it was actually correct.	type 1 error	What analogy is used to explain type 1 error (machine learning)?
A type 1 error is often likened to being falsely accused of a crime. Just as with the criminal justice system, it is important to minimize the chances of making a mistake.	type 1 error	What analogy is used to explain type 1 error (machine learning)?
Type 2 error is similar to a person in a dark room flipping on a light switch and not seeing anything because they were initially looking in the wrong direction.	type 2 error	What analogy is used to explain type 2 error (machine learning)?
The analogy is that type 2 error is like a false positive in cancer screening. A false positive means that the test incorrectly identifies healthy tissue as being cancerous. This can lead to unnecessary treatments, such as surgery, and create anxiety for patients.	type 2 error	What analogy is used to explain type 2 error (machine learning)?
Type 2 error is similar to a person flipping a coin and getting Heads five times in a row. The chances of this happening are very slim, but it is not impossible. In the same way, Type 2 errors can happen in machine learning when we are incorrectly predicting that something is not spam when it actually is, or vice versa.	type 2 error	What analogy is used to explain type 2 error (machine learning)?
Type 2 error is often likened to a false negative result in a medical test. Just as a patient may be told they are healthy when they actually have cancer, type 2 error occurs when an algorithm incorrectly decides that something is not happening (when it actually is).	type 2 error	What analogy is used to explain type 2 error (machine learning)?
Type 2 error is equivalent to a false negative. In the context of machine learning, type 2 error means that your model is not accurately detecting the true positive examples in your data set. This can happen when your model is overfitting or when you have too few training samples.	type 2 error	What analogy is used to explain type 2 error (machine learning)?
The analogy is between overfitting and a leaky bucket. The goal of machine learning is to learn how to predict future events based on past data, much like trying to figure out how much water will flow out of a bucket each second by observing how much water flows out in the first few seconds. If you only look at the first few seconds, your prediction may be very accurate because it’s based on what has actually happened recently. However, if you keep looking at the data over time, eventually you will see that more and more water is flowing out of the bucket than was originally predicted – this is analogous to overfitting where the model keeps “learning” new patterns in the data that don’t actually exist.	underfitting	What analogy is used to explain underfitting (machine learning)?
Underfitting is like trying to learn a song by only listening to the first verse and chorus. You might be able to remember the words, but you won't know how the song progresses.	underfitting	What analogy is used to explain underfitting (machine learning)?
Underfitting is like when you try to learn a new skill by watching one or two youtube videos. You might be able to do the skill, but it won't be perfect and you'll definitely not be as good as someone who has been doing the skill for years.	underfitting	What analogy is used to explain underfitting (machine learning)?
Underfitting is like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. The machine learning algorithm is not able to find the right pattern among the data and ends up with poor predictions.	underfitting	What analogy is used to explain underfitting (machine learning)?
Underfitting is like teaching a child to read by giving them one word examples. The child can learn the meaning of the word, but will be unable to apply it in a sentence.	underfitting	What analogy is used to explain underfitting (machine learning)?
A doctor is trying to find a treatment for a patient. She has many potential treatments, but she doesn't know which one is the best for the patient. After trying several treatments, she finds that one of them seems to work better than the others. However, she can't be sure if it's really the best treatment or if it just happened to work by chance. To figure out whether the treatment is truly effective, she tests it on other patients and compares their results with those of the first patient. If most of the other patients show similar improvements, then she can say that the treatment is likely effective.The universal approximation theorem in machine learning works in a similar way. It allows machines to learn how to do specific tasks by trying different approaches and seeing which one works best. The theorem ensures that no matter what type of task you want your machine learning algorithm to perform, there will always be some approach that can get close enough to achieve good results."	universal approximation theorem	What analogy is used to explain universal approximation theorem (machine learning)?
The analogy is that universal approximation theorem is like a map. A map can show you how to get from one place to another, even if the places are very far apart. The theorem tells us that we can use machines learning algorithms to approximate any function, no matter how complex it is.	universal approximation theorem	What analogy is used to explain universal approximation theorem (machine learning)?
The theorem states that any function can be approximated by a polynomial within a certain radius of error. This is similar to saying that you can find a curve that closely fits all the points in a set, as long as the curve isn't too wiggly.	universal approximation theorem	What analogy is used to explain universal approximation theorem (machine learning)?
The theorem states that any function that can be approximated by a polynomial on a certain number of input variables, can be accurately approximated by a machine learning algorithm with the same number of hidden layers (or more).	universal approximation theorem	What analogy is used to explain universal approximation theorem (machine learning)?

It can measure any function within 1/1000th of an inch, no matter how complex the curve may be.	universal approximation theorem	What analogy is used to explain universal approximation theorem (machine learning)?
One analogy for unsupervised learning is that it is like a person being given a new city to live in without any street maps or guides. The person would need to explore the city on their own and learn its layout in order to get around. In the same way, unsupervised learning algorithms need data to "explore" in order to learn how different features are related.	unsupervised learning	What analogy is used to explain unsupervised learning (machine learning)?
An analogy that is frequently used to explain unsupervised learning is that it is similar to a child who is in a room filled with toys, and the child is playing with some of the toys without any help from adults. The child is able to learn about how the toys work by exploring them on their own. In the same way, unsupervised learning algorithms can learn about the structure and properties of data by exploring it on their own.	unsupervised learning	What analogy is used to explain unsupervised learning (machine learning)?
Unsupervised learning is similar to the process of human brain development. Young children are constantly exposed to new experiences and learn from observing their environments without any explicit instruction. As they grow older, they gradually learn how to categorize and group different stimuli into recognizable patterns. Unsupervised learning algorithms use a similar approach, by automatically detecting patterns in data and building models based on those observations.	unsupervised learning	What analogy is used to explain unsupervised learning (machine learning)?
This analogy is used to explain unsupervised learning (machine learning): A child who is not taught a particular language in school can still learn it by listening to people speaking that language around them. Similarly, a machine can learn how to recognize objects and patterns without being explicitly programmed to do so, by "watching" examples of those objects and patterns.	unsupervised learning	What analogy is used to explain unsupervised learning (machine learning)?
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the computer system is left to learn on its own from data that has not been labeled. The most common analogy used to explain this process is that it is similar to how a baby learns to distinguish different objects and colors. At first, the infant does not know what a dog or cat looks like, but over time they will start to identify these animals as separate from other things in their environment.	unsupervised learning	What analogy is used to explain unsupervised learning (machine learning)?
A validation set is used as a way of ensuring that the machine learning algorithm is working correctly. It is essentially a "test" dataset which is used to check that the model being trained on the data is actually able to correctly predict outcomes.	validation set	What analogy is used to explain validation set (machine learning)?
An analogy for validation set is as if you are baking a cake. You would use an oven to cook the cake, and you would use a timer to tell when the cake is done. The oven is like your training data, and the timer is like your validation set.	validation set	What analogy is used to explain validation set (machine learning)?
A validation set is used to estimate how well a machine learning algorithm will perform on unseen data. The analogy that is often used is that the validation set is like a weather forecast. The validation set can tell us how likely it is that the machine learning algorithm will predict future events correctly, but it cannot tell us exactly what the weather will be like tomorrow.	validation set	What analogy is used to explain validation set (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain validation set (machine learning) is that it is like a teacher. The validation set helps the machine learn which techniques work best so that it can generalize what it has learned to new instances in the future.	validation set	What analogy is used to explain validation set (machine learning)?
The validation set is used in machine learning as an analogy to explain the concept of a training set. A validation set is used to test how well a model can generalize from the data it has been trained on to new data. This is done by splitting the data into two sets, one for training and one for testing. The model is then trained on the first set and tested on the second set.	validation set	What analogy is used to explain validation set (machine learning)?
A good analogy for variance is the difference between traveling by plane and driving a car. By plane, your distance from origin to destination is largely determined by the pilot. If there are any delays or problems along the way, it will be the pilot’s responsibility to correct them. By car, on the other hand, you have more control over your journey. You can make choices about what route to take and how fast to drive that will affect how long it takes you to get from point A to point B. In both cases, you’ll end up at your destination, but the experience of getting there will be different.	variance	What analogy is used to explain variance (machine learning)?
Variance is like the speed of a car. The more variance there is, the faster the car goes.	variance	What analogy is used to explain variance (machine learning)?
Similar to how individuals in a population can have different physical characteristics, such as height, weight, and eye color; individual data points in a dataset can have different values for the same attribute. Just as there is natural variation in human populations, there is natural variation in data. This variation is measured by the standard deviation.	variance	What analogy is used to explain variance (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain variance is that it is the difference between the expected outcome and the actual outcome. If you think of a machine learning algorithm as trying to predict an outcome, then variance is what causes our predictions to be inaccurate. This can be due to random variation in our data, or because our model isn't quite perfect.	variance	What analogy is used to explain variance (machine learning)?
Variance is similar to the concept of entropy in information theory. Just as entropy measures the amount of uncertainty in a message, variance measures the amount of uncertainty in a set of data.	variance	What analogy is used to explain variance (machine learning)?
A/B testing is commonly compared to the process of tasting two different wines and selecting the one you prefer. In this analogy, each wine is a possible version of your website or app (A or B) and you are the taster. You sample each wine and then select the one that you like best.	a/b testing	What analogy is used to explain a/b testing (machine learning)?
A/b testing is commonly used in machine learning to refer to the process of comparing two different algorithms or models on a data set, usually by splitting the data set in half and using each algorithm on one half.	a/b testing	What analogy is used to explain a/b testing (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy for a/b testing is that of a bakery. In any bakery there are many different flavors and types of bread. The baker has to test out which combinations of breads and flavors work well together. They might have an idea in their head about what they want, but until they test it out they won't know for sure. The same is true with machine learning algorithms - you never really know which one will be the best until you test them out.	a/b testing	What analogy is used to explain a/b testing (machine learning)?
A/B testing is like a science experiment. You have two versions of something (A and B), and you want to know which one works better. To figure this out, you test them both on some people and see which one they like better.	a/b testing	What analogy is used to explain a/b testing (machine learning)?
A/B testing is commonly referred to as "the scientific method" of marketing. It's the way to test whether or not a change you make (in your marketing) has an impact on what you're trying to achieve (more customers, more sales, etc.). Basically, it works like this: You have two groups of people that are identical in every way except for one variable (the thing you're testing). You then measure how each group responds to a particular treatment (e.g., does Group A buy more product when we show them ads with a green button versus blue button?) and compare the results. If there's a statistically significant difference between the two groups, then you can say that your treatment had an effect.	a/b testing	What analogy is used to explain a/b testing (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain machine learning is that it is like the brain. The brain can learn and recognize patterns over time.	action	What analogy is used to explain action (machine learning)?
The analogy of learning in machines is very similar to the way humans learn. When a person sees something for the first time, they might be confused about what it is. After seeing it multiple times, they will start to understand what it is and what it does. The same concept applies to machines. They are given data (examples) and through repeated exposure, they will gradually start to understand and learn from that data.	action	What analogy is used to explain action (machine learning)?

The analogy used to explain action is the computer. The computer takes in an input, such as a keyboard stroke, and then outputs an answer, such as the letter "a." In the same way, a machine learning algorithm takes in input data and outputs a prediction.	action	What analogy is used to explain action (machine learning)?
The analogy of action is learning is that it is like being a passenger in a car. The driver (teacher) guides the car while the passenger (learner) observes and learns from their surroundings.	action	What analogy is used to explain action (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain activation functions in machine learning is the use of a curler iron. The heat from the curler iron causes the hair to curl. In a similar way, the activation function in machine learning causes a neuron to "fire" or become activated.	activation function	What analogy is used to explain activation function (machine learning)?
An activation function is like a "gate" in an electronic circuit. It controls the flow of electricity (or data) through the circuit.	activation function	What analogy is used to explain activation function (machine learning)?
A neuron in the brain is like a computer with an input, a processing unit and an output. The input is the information that comes into the neuron from other neurons. The processing unit is called the activation function. This function decides how much of the input will be passed on to the next neuron. The output of a neuron is what it sends out to other neurons.	activation function	What analogy is used to explain activation function (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy for an activation function is a car's gas pedal. The more you press the gas pedal, the more power your car has to accelerate. In the same way, the greater the input value to an activation function, the greater its output will be.	activation function	What analogy is used to explain activation function (machine learning)?
An analogy used to explain activation function in machine learning is that it is like a pump. The input data (water) is pumped into the system (the activation function), and then the system pumps out the result (the output data).	activation function	What analogy is used to explain activation function (machine learning)?
The analogy of a student is used to explain active learning. A teacher will provide a student with a question and the student will then have to think about an answer. The teacher will then provide feedback to the student on their answer. This process is repeated until the student has learned the material.	active learning	What analogy is used to explain active learning (machine learning)?
Active learning is similar to the way humans learn. We are constantly exposed to new information and we use what we know to try and make sense of it. With active learning, computers are given some training data and they use that data to learn how to identify patterns.	active learning	What analogy is used to explain active learning (machine learning)?
An analogy for active learning is a person who is learning a new language. The person does not sit in a classroom and listen to someone else talk about the language all day long. Instead, the person spends time speaking the language with others, listening to recordings of native speakers, and reading texts in the language. This allows the person to learn more quickly and effectively than if they had simply listened to a teacher's explanation in a classroom setting.	active learning	What analogy is used to explain active learning (machine learning)?
Active learning is often compared to the process of a human learner. Just as a person needs some examples of what they are trying to learn in order to understand it, a machine also needs data that is representative of what it is learning. The more data that is fed into the machine, the better its chances of learning and making accurate predictions or classifications.	active learning	What analogy is used to explain active learning (machine learning)?
The analogy that is most commonly used to explain active learning is the process of teaching a child how to walk. A parent or teacher does not just wait for the child to randomly stumble and then try to correct them. Instead, they provide gentle guidance and encouragement until the child learns how to walk on their own. Active learning in machine learning works in a similar way. Algorithms are constantly provided with feedback so that they can learn from their mistakes and improve over time.	active learning	What analogy is used to explain active learning (machine learning)?

A popular analogy for agglomerative clustering is the process of finding a way to organize a large pile of assorted objects into smaller and more manageable piles. The first step is to take all of the objects and put them in one big pile. Then, you start sorting through the items and pulling out any that are similar.

Analogy:Detecting anomalies is a bit like looking for a needle in a haystack. The goal is to find items that don’t quite fit with the rest of the data.

The analogy used to explain anomaly detection is that it is like a “sneeze in a crowd.” In other words, when something unusual happens (the sneeze), it stands out among the rest of what is happening (the crowd).

An analogy that is often used to explain area under the curve is comparing it to a long, flat beach. At one end of the beach there are large waves crashing against the shore, while at the other end the waves are much smaller. If you were to walk from one end of the beach to the other, you would be able to measure how tall each wave was and then plot this information on a graph. The height of each wave would create a bumpy line on your graph as you move from left to right. However, if you were to take all of these individual measurements and then draw a smooth curve through them, this would represent the average height of waves along the entire beach. This smooth curve would give you an idea of how big the waves are on average and it would also show you how they vary in size as you move up and down the beach.	area under the roc curve	What analogy is used to explain area under the roc curve (machine learning)?

A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a black box. Inputs (x) are fed in and an output (y) is generated. The goal is to make the output as accurate as possible. There are many different ways to measure accuracy, but one popular way is to use average precision.To understand average precision, let's imagine you're playing a game of Solitaire. Your goal is to get all the cards into their correct suits in the least number of moves possible. You start by dealing out four cards face-up on the table: two clubs, a heart, and a spade. The first move is easy - just place the club card onto the other club card. Now there are only three cards left: one heart and two spades. How do you choose which card to move next?One way to decide would be to consider how many moves it will take you to put each individual card in its correct suit. The heart can go either on top of the other heart or on top of the spade, so that's two possibilities. But putting the spade at the bottom means that there are now only two options for where to put the last remaining card: Either another heart or another spade. So altogether, there are three possible outcomes for your second move: {heart,heart}, {spade,heart}, {spade,spade}. If we want to find out how likely it is that movingcard will result in putting allcards in their respective suits,, then we'd divide 2/3rds (the probability of getting hearts when moving one from among three facedown cards) by 3 (the total number of outcomes). This gives us an average precision score for this particular game board stateof 66%.	average precision	What analogy is used to explain average precision (machine learning)?

The ingredients are put into the oven (the algorithm) and cooked until done. The result is hopefully a delicious cake!	batch	What analogy is used to explain batch (machine learning)?
Batch learning is similar to making a pot of coffee. The first time you make coffee, you have to measure out the amount of coffee and water, put it in a pot, and heat it up. Then you have to wait for the coffee to brew. Once it's done brewing, you can pour yourself a cup of coffee. The next time you want some coffee, you can just measure out how much coffee you want and put it in the pot with hot water. You don't have to wait for the pot of coffee to brew again because the last batch is still warm.	batch	What analogy is used to explain batch (machine learning)?

If you put in cold water, the heat will take longer to reach the center of the pot than if you put in hot water. In the same way, neural networks learn slower when they are presented with data that is not already normalized.	batch normalization	What analogy is used to explain batch normalization (machine learning)?
A professor is grading a batch of papers. She wants to make sure that each student's grade is fair and accurate, so she normalizes the grades by dividing them by the number of students in the class. This gives each student an individual normalized grade.

Batch normalization is a technique used in machine learning for reducing the variance of input data. It can be thought of as analogous to the practice of homogenizing milk before it is sold at a grocery store.

The analogy is that of a student in school. A student's raw score might be 72 out of 100, but their grade would not be a C because the weighted average of all grades in the class is a D+.

This can also be thought of as adjusting for outliers.	batch normalization	What analogy is used to explain batch normalization (machine learning)?
One analogy to help understand batch normalization is that it’s like pouring a pitcher of water into a glass — the water gradually becomes distributed more evenly as it mixes with the rest of the liquid in the glass.

The analogy of batch size in machine learning is the same as when you are cooking a pot of soup. The more soup you cook at once, the less time it will take to cook in total. However, if you only cook a small pot of soup, it will take longer to cook. Batch size works in a similar way with machine learning. If you have a large dataset to learn from, your algorithm can learn faster because there is more data for it to analyze. Conversely, if you have a smaller dataset, it will take longer for the algorithm to learn from that data set.	batch size	What analogy is used to explain batch size (machine learning)?
A batch is the size of a set of data "fed" into a machine-learning algorithm at once. The idea behind splitting up training data into batches is that it allows the algorithm to learn incrementally as new data arrives, rather than waiting until the entire dataset is available before starting to learn.	batch size	What analogy is used to explain batch size (machine learning)?
Batch size (machine learning) is often compared to the batch size of a manufacturing assembly line. Just as it takes time to produce items on an assembly line, it also takes time to "produce" results from machine learning algorithms. The larger the batch size, the more data that can be processed at one time; but, as with any production process, there is a trade-off between speed and accuracy.	batch size	What analogy is used to explain batch size (machine learning)?
A bayesian neural network is a machine learning algorithm that works by modifying its own weights and biases in response to feedback from the data. It can be thought of as a "learning" algorithm, because it gets better at predicting things as it goes along.	bayesian neural network	What analogy is used to explain bayesian neural network (machine learning)?
A bayesian neural network can be thought of as a group of people, where each person has their own opinion on the likelihood of something happening. The group’s overall belief is the result of taking into account all of the individual opinions.	bayesian neural network	What analogy is used to explain bayesian neural network (machine learning)?
A bayesian neural network is like a group of people trying to guess the answer to a question. Each person has their own opinion, and as they hear other people's opinions, they update their own opinion based on what they've heard.	bayesian neural network	What analogy is used to explain bayesian neural network (machine learning)?
A bayesian neural network (machine learning) can be thought of as a group of people who have never met before, but each has been given a dossier on the other. Through a series of interactions, they are able to form opinions about one another by exchanging information and updating their beliefs accordingly.	bayesian neural network	What analogy is used to explain bayesian neural network (machine learning)?
Bayesian neural networks are like a group of people, each with their own opinion about some topic. The group’s collective view is the result of averaging the individual opinions, with more weight given to the views of those who have more information and expertise on the topic.	bayesian neural network	What analogy is used to explain bayesian neural network (machine learning)?
Machine learning is like a cat. It can be difficult to know what the machine is doing or how it works, but it often performs better than humans when it comes to finding patterns in data.	bayesian optimization	What analogy is used to explain bayesian optimization (machine learning)?
The analogy is that of a farmer who has several plots of land and wants to know which one will yield the best crop. The farmer can randomly choose a plot of land, or he can use information about each plot (such as rainfall, soil type, etc) to make a decision about which one to plant his crops in. In the same way, Bayesian optimization uses information about past performance (the "training data") to help it figure out how to optimize future performance.	bayesian optimization	What analogy is used to explain bayesian optimization (machine learning)?
An analogy is used to explain bayesian optimization (machine learning). It is similar to the way a person learns how to drive a car. The first time a person drives, they are likely uncomfortable and make many mistakes. However, with experience, that same person becomes more comfortable behind the wheel and their driving skills improve. The same is true for machine learning algorithms; the more data they are exposed to, the better they become at performing their task.	bayesian optimization	What analogy is used to explain bayesian optimization (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is like a person with a set of preferences trying to find the best restaurant. The algorithm starts by ruling out some restaurants because they don't fit its preferences (e.g. too expensive, bad reviews). It then evaluates the remaining restaurants one at a time and selects the one that is most likely to be the best according to its preferences.	bayesian optimization	What analogy is used to explain bayesian optimization (machine learning)?
An analogy for Bayesian optimization is that of a person exploring a new city. The person begins by learning the layout of the city, then starts to explore different areas, gradually coming to know which parts of the city are worth visiting. At each step, they incorporate what they have learned in previous steps (e.g., which neighborhoods are close together) to better inform their current decision about where to go next.	bayesian optimization	What analogy is used to explain bayesian optimization (machine learning)?
The analogy is that the bellman equation is like a map. It tells you how to get from one point to another.	bellman equation	What analogy is used to explain bellman equation (machine learning)?
An analogy for the Bellman equation is a traveler in a maze. The traveler has to find their way through the maze to get to the exit. They can only move forward, and they have to keep track of where they are so they can find their way back. In machine learning, the "maze" is the training set, and the "exit" is the desired output. The goal is to find a path from the starting point (the input) to the exit that minimizes error.	bellman equation	What analogy is used to explain bellman equation (machine learning)?
An analogy used to explain the bellman equation is as follows: imagine you are hiking in the mountains and come to a fork in the path. One path leads up a hill and the other goes down. You do not know which path leads to your desired destination, but you know that whichever path you take, it will be farther than if you stayed put. In this analogy, taking either path is an action and reaching your destination is the goal. The bellman equation helps determine which of two possible actions is most likely to get you closer to your goal.	bellman equation	What analogy is used to explain bellman equation (machine learning)?
The analogy of the bellman equation is learning to ride a bike. When you are first starting out, it can be difficult to keep your balance and stay upright. But with practice, you get better at it and eventually it becomes second nature. The Bellman equation is like a mathematical model that helps you learn how to ride a bike by providing feedback on your progress.	bellman equation	What analogy is used to explain bellman equation (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain bellman equation (machine learning) is that of a traveler in a maze. The traveler starts at the entrance to the maze and has to find their way to the exit. Along the way, they may encounter obstacles or dead ends, but they also collect rewards for reaching certain points in the maze. The goal of the traveler is to make it to the exit as quickly as possible, while maximizing their rewards. In the same way, machine learning algorithms try to find solutions that reach a goal (such as correctly identifying an object in a picture), while minimizing penalties (such as incorrect identifications).	bellman equation	What analogy is used to explain bellman equation (machine learning)?
Analogy: Bert is similar to a transformer. Transformers convert electrical energy from one voltage level to another, and they can also change the shape of the waveform. Bert similarly converts between different encoder representations (e.g., representing text as a bag-of-words or as a sequence of character n-grams), and it can also change the shape of the representation (e.g., by compressing rare words).	bert (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers)	What analogy is used to explain bert (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) (machine learning)?
The analogy of bert is used to explain the machine learning. It is said that a transformer can be seen as two different models, one in which it predicts the next word in a sentence given its predecessor and one in which it predicts the preceding word given the following word.	bert (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers)	What analogy is used to explain bert (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy to Bert is that of a two-way mirror. Just as with a two-way mirror, data (1s and 0s) flows in both directions across Bert—from the input layer to the output layer, and from the output layer back to the input layer. However, data can only flow in one direction at a time; so, when data is flowing from the input layer to the output layer, it cannot be influenced by data that is flowing from the output layer back to the input layer. This way of thinking about Bert helps make sense of how it works: Bert uses a combination of encoders and decoders (like those found in optical character recognition systems) to learn representations of words or other items in order for them to be recognized later on.	bert (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers)	What analogy is used to explain bert (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) (machine learning)?
An analogy to understand Bert is to think of it as a machine learning transformer that takes in two input vectors (one for the encoder and one for the decoder) and produces a single vector output. Just like with Transformers, Bert can learn how to best encode or decode a particular sequence of data by adjusting its settings based on feedback from experience.	bert (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers)	What analogy is used to explain bert (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) (machine learning)?
A transformer is a type of machine learning algorithm that is used to learn representations of data. It is similar to a neural network, but it uses a different type of activation function called a “transformer” kernel. Transformers are used for tasks such as natural language processing and image recognition.	bert (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers)	What analogy is used to explain bert (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) (machine learning)?
An analogy that is often used to explain bias in machine learning is the example of a person’s first impression of someone they meet. If this person has a preconceived notion about what type of person they are likely to meet, based on their past experiences or preconceived notions, then this will affect how they perceive the new person they have just met. In the same way, if a machine learning algorithm is biased against certain types of data (e.g. race, ethnicity), then it will be more likely to classify those data points as being something else other than what they actually are (i.e. inaccurate classification).	bias (ethics/fairness)	What analogy is used to explain bias (ethics/fairness) (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is biased if it consistently performs worse on one group of data than another. For example, imagine that an algorithm trained on images of women is used to identify faces in photos. This algorithm would be biased against men, because it would be more likely to incorrectly identify a man’s face as a woman’s face.	bias (ethics/fairness)	What analogy is used to explain bias (ethics/fairness) (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is biased if it consistently produces inaccurate predictions for a particular subset of the data. This can be due to several factors, such as a limited number of training examples or an incorrect model assumption.	bias (ethics/fairness)	What analogy is used to explain bias (ethics/fairness) (machine learning)?
A biased coin has a higher chance of landing on one side than the other. This analogy can be used to explain bias in machine learning algorithms. A biased algorithm will have a higher chance of producing inaccurate results than an unbiased algorithm.	bias (ethics/fairness)	What analogy is used to explain bias (ethics/fairness) (machine learning)?
A biased coin is one that comes up heads more often than tails. A biased person is someone who always favors one side of an issue, even when the evidence doesn't support their position.	bias (ethics/fairness)	What analogy is used to explain bias (ethics/fairness) (machine learning)?
The bias in a machine learning algorithm is similar to the bias in a mathematical function. Just as a mathematical function can be thought of as a way to map inputs to outputs, a machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a way to map input data points to predictions. The bias in a function arises when the mapping from inputs to outputs is not completely accurate. This inaccuracy can be due to various factors, such as noise in the input data or inaccurate models of how the real world works. Similarly, the bias in a machine learning algorithm arises when the prediction model is not perfectly accurate. This inaccuracy can be due to various factors, such as random errors in the training data or inaccuracies in our understanding of how reality works.	bias (math)	What analogy is used to explain bias (math) (machine learning)?
In math and machine learning, bias is a measure of how far off a function's predictions are from the actual values. In other words, bias quantifies how consistently a model performs on average relative to the ground-truth labels or expected values.	bias (math)	What analogy is used to explain bias (math) (machine learning)?
An analogy to bias in machine learning is a person’s belief that one number is more likely to occur than another number. This belief affects the person’s choice when playing games such as roulette, even if they are not consciously aware of it. In the same way, biases in machine learning can be introduced through incorrect assumptions about data or by artificially engineering data so that a particular outcome is more likely.	bias (math)	What analogy is used to explain bias (math) (machine learning)?
A bias is like a bent ruler; it skews the results of the measurement. In machine learning, if there is bias in the training set (the data that the machine learning algorithm uses to learn), this can distort the predictions made by the algorithm.	bias (math)	What analogy is used to explain bias (math) (machine learning)?
A biased coin has two sides, one with a higher probability of landing on heads than the other. In math, bias is when a function or estimate consistently underestimates or overestimates certain values. In machine learning, bias is when a model produces incorrect predictions for some input data because it was trained using an unrepresentative subset of all available data.	bias (math)	What analogy is used to explain bias (math) (machine learning)?

A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a teacher. At the beginning, it has no idea what is right or wrong. It starts by giving some examples to the student (or machine), and then observes how the student responds. Based on the student’s responses, the teacher adapts its teaching method to better match what works best for that particular student. Over time, the teacher becomes better and better at predicting how the student will respond in new situations, allowing it to give more accurate instruction. This process is known as “machine learning” because computers are able to learn from experience just like people do.	bidirectional	What analogy is used to explain bidirectional (machine learning)?
Analogy: Bidirectional machine learning is similar to a two-way conversation between people. In this analogy, the machine learning algorithm is like one person, and the data is like the other person.

The machine learning model can understand and produce text in multiple languages equally well.	bidirectional language model	What analogy is used to explain bidirectional language model (machine learning)?
A binary classifier is a machine learning algorithm that can be used to distinguish between two categories, or classes. For example, you might use a binary classifier to determine whether an email is spam or not spam.	binary classification	What analogy is used to explain binary classification (machine learning)?
Binary classification is similar to the process of sorting an unsorted stack of papers into two piles, labeled “A” and “B”. The first step is to take any paper from the top of the stack and determine which pile it should go in: if it belongs in pile A, then put it in pile A; if it belongs in pile B, then put it in pile B. If the paper doesn’t belong in either pile (it’s not sorted), put it back on top of the stack. Now repeat this process for every other paper on top of the stack: if it belongs in one of the piles, put it there; otherwise, leave it on top of the stack.	binary classification	What analogy is used to explain binary classification (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain binary classification is that it is like a person being able to distinguish between cats and dogs. By being taught what each animal looks like, the person can then accurately identify whether an animal they see is a cat or a dog. In the same way, by being taught what different types of objects look like (e.g. a stop sign versus a speed limit sign), a machine learning algorithm can be taught how to accurately identify objects in images.	binary classification	What analogy is used to explain binary classification (machine learning)?
Binary classification is similar to dividing things into two categories: yes or no, alive or dead, black or white.

The binary classification analogy is used to explain machine learning. Just as a human can be taught to distinguish between different types of animals by being shown pictures of those animals and being told whether each one is a dog or a cat, a computer can be taught to distinguish between different types of objects by being shown images of those objects and being told whether each one is a car or a truck.	binary classification	What analogy is used to explain binary classification (machine learning)?
Binning is the process of reducing the number of unique values in a data set by grouping similar values together. It is often used in machine learning to improve performance. For example, imagine you are trying to learn how to predict whether someone will buy a product or not. You might have data on 1000 people, but there are many possible ways to group them (by age, gender, income level, etc.). If you reduce the number of groups from 1000 to 10, it will be much easier for your machine learning algorithm to learn from the data.	binning	What analogy is used to explain binning (machine learning)?
Binning is similar to the way that humans group things. For example, when we meet someone for the first time, we might put them into one of two categories: familiar or unfamiliar. If they are familiar, then we might subdivide the familiar category further by looking at their relationship to us (e.g., friend, family member, co-worker).	binning	What analogy is used to explain binning (machine learning)?
The analogy of binning is to think of it as a way of sorting data into bins or categories. In other words, you are taking all the data and dividing it up into groups (or bins) so that it is easier to understand and work with.	binning	What analogy is used to explain binning (machine learning)?
One analogy for binning is "categorizing data into buckets." You might divide fruits into categories such as berries, stone fruit, and citrus.

The analogy of bleu is that it is similar to being bilingual. Just as someone who can speak two languages fluently can understand both, a machine learning algorithm that has been "trained" on one dataset can understand data from another dataset with which it has not been explicitly trained.	bleu (bilingual evaluation understudy)	What analogy is used to explain bleu (bilingual evaluation understudy) (machine learning)?
When it comes to bilingual education, a “bleu” is a student who is in the process of learning English. They are usually still enrolled in a foreign language program at school and will receive support from a teacher who is specifically trained in how to help students learn language. Just as machines can be taught how to learn by being programmed with specific rules, bleus follow similar steps as they acquire new vocabulary and grammar structures.	bleu (bilingual evaluation understudy)	What analogy is used to explain bleu (bilingual evaluation understudy) (machine learning)?

The boost algorithm can be seen as a kind of "machine learning metropolis algorithm". The key difference is that boosting iteratively creates new models, while the metropolis algorithm only creates one model.	boosting	What analogy is used to explain boosting (machine learning)?
Boosting is like teaching a child to read. At first, the child may only be able to read simple words, but with practice and instruction, the child can eventually read more complex texts. The same is true for boosting: it starts by learning how to recognize basic patterns, but with more training data and iterations, it can learn more complicated patterns.	boosting	What analogy is used to explain boosting (machine learning)?
One analogy for boosting is that it is like a cafeteria line in which people can "queue up" to receive different food items. In the machine learning context, this means that a series of algorithms can be applied one after another (or "in parallel") to a data set in order to improve the accuracy of the predictions made by the model.	boosting	What analogy is used to explain boosting (machine learning)?
Boosting is a machine learning technique that can be used to improve the accuracy of predictions made by a classification or regression model.

The final prediction is then computed as a weighted average of the predictions generated by all of the individual models.	boosting	What analogy is used to explain boosting (machine learning)?
One analogy to boosting is that of a coffee shop. The first time you go to a coffee shop, the barista may not know how you like your coffee. However, if you tell the barista how you like your coffee each time you go to the coffee shop, they will eventually learn what type of coffee you like and start making it for you every time. Boosting is similar in that it uses past data to improve future predictions.	boosting	What analogy is used to explain boosting (machine learning)?

A good analogy for understanding candidate generation is to think of it as sifting through a pile of sand looking for gold. The “candidate” in this analogy would be the gold, and the machine learning algorithm is the person doing the sifting.

The goal is to find the best way to “tune” the black box so that its predictions improve over time. This process can be likened to tuning a guitar: you start with a rough idea of how you want the instrument to sound, and then you tweak the tuning knobs until the notes sound just right.	candidate sampling	What analogy is used to explain candidate sampling (machine learning)?
One analogy used to explain categorical data is that it is like a deck of cards. Each card in the deck has a specific value, and each position (or rank) on the card corresponds to a different value. For example, the Ace of Spades might have a value of 1, while the Two of Hearts might have a value of 2. Just as there are 52 cards in a deck, there are also 52 possible values for categorical data.	categorical data	What analogy is used to explain categorical data (machine learning)?
One analogy for categorical data is to think of them as buckets. The buckets can be any size and shape, and may or may not have the same number of slots. But each bucket only holds a certain type of thing. So if you want to put a toy car in one bucket, it will go in the toy car bucket; if you want to put a toy truck in that same bucket, it won't fit because trucks don't go in cars' places.	categorical data	What analogy is used to explain categorical data (machine learning)?

In the game, each domino is a unit of evidence and it topple over another domino if there is a relationship between them (e.g., A topples B if B is next to an A). The goal for machine learning algorithms using causal language models is to find all of the relationships between the units of evidence in order to predict which domino will topple next.	causal language model	What analogy is used to explain causal language model (machine learning)?
The analogy used is that of a train. The tracks are the input, and the engine is the machine learning algorithm.

A machine learning analogy for co-adaptation is two people in a canoe. If one person paddles on the right side, and the other person paddles on the left side, they will move the canoe forward. If they both paddle on the same side, the canoe will not move as quickly. In order for the canoe to move quickly (and achieve their goal), each person needs to be aware of what the other person is doing and adapt their own behavior accordingly.	co-adaptation	What analogy is used to explain co-adaptation (machine learning)?
The analogy of a brain and computer is often used to explain co-adaptation. The human brain can be seen as a machine that has learned how to adapt to its environment, while computers are machines that have been programmed to adapt to their environment.

A collaborative filtering algorithm is like a person who has read lots of books. This person can recommend books to others because they have personal experience with them.	collaborative filtering	What analogy is used to explain collaborative filtering (machine learning)?
If you think of collaborative filtering as a way to predict how you’ll like something, it’s sort of like getting a recommendation from a friend. You know your friends pretty well, so if one of them tells you that she really likes a book or movie, you’re likely to trust her judgment and give it a try.	collaborative filtering	What analogy is used to explain collaborative filtering (machine learning)?

A human is like a computer in that each stores information and uses it to make decisions. The computer can be taught, through a process of input (teaching) and output (practice), to recognize patterns in data.

A machine learning algorithm is like a person with an opinion. The more data the machine learning algorithm has, the stronger its opinion will be.	confirmation bias	What analogy is used to explain confirmation bias (machine learning)?
Confirmation bias is the tendency to pay more attention to information that confirms our beliefs than to information that contradicts them. This analogy compares it to a machine learning algorithm, which “learns” by being fed data that has been labeled as correct or incorrect. The algorithm will be more likely to classify future data as correct if it has been consistently given accurate labels in the past. In the same way, people are more likely to believe something if they have heard it multiple times from multiple sources, regardless of whether or not it is true.	confirmation bias	What analogy is used to explain confirmation bias (machine learning)?

A function is continuous if given any two points within the function's domain, there exists a smooth curve that connects those points. In other words, there are no sudden jumps or breaks in the slope of the line between any two points on the graph representing the function. This analogy can be used to understand how machine learning algorithms work by detecting patterns in data. Just as a continuous curve can be drawn between any two points on a graph, so too can a machine learn to identify patterns in data even if they are not directly visible.	continuous feature	What analogy is used to explain continuous feature (machine learning)?
Continuous feature (machine learning) can be explained as the process of gradually teaching a computer how to identify objects in digital images. The computer is shown many different images of objects, and it is slowly taught how to identify each object. This allows the computer to recognize objects in new images that it has never seen before.	continuous feature	What analogy is used to explain continuous feature (machine learning)?
A physical example of a continuous feature is temperature. We can measure the temperature at any given point in time and space, and it can be considered a continuous feature.	continuous feature	What analogy is used to explain continuous feature (machine learning)?
A convenience store is a business that sells items to the public for immediate consumption.

Convenience sampling is used to describe the process of selecting a small number of observations or examples from a larger population in order to make generalisations about the entire population. The analogy that is most often used to explain convenience sampling is that it is like choosing which items to put in your grocery cart at the supermarket. You might only pick a few items from the produce section, the meat section, and the dairy section in order to get an idea of what's available at the store. You're not likely to choose every item from each section, but you'll have a sense of what's available based on the few choices you made.	convenience sampling	What analogy is used to explain convenience sampling (machine learning)?

However, it would be much easier (and faster) to catch a few of those fish and study them in a tank in your backyard. This is what is meant by “convenience sampling” in terms of machine learning – it is easier/faster to use data that is readily available rather than gathering data from across the entire population.	convenience sampling	What analogy is used to explain convenience sampling (machine learning)?
One analogy for convenience sampling in machine learning is to think of it as a vending machine. The user (e.g. customer) puts in a request and the machine gives back what was asked for, without requiring further input from the user.

The function might be straightforward, like a linear regression model that takes in one input variable and outputs a prediction for the target variable. Or it might be more complex, like a deep neural network with dozens of layers. In either case, the function is "convex" because there is always some path from the input to the output that guarantees at least some level of performance or accuracy. This stands in contrast to non-convex functions which have no such guarantee: no matter how close you get to the optimum solution, there's always a chance that you could do better by taking a different path.	convex function	What analogy is used to explain convex function (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a function that takes in an input (a training dataset) and produces an output (a model).

A machine learning convex optimization problem can be thought of as a maze. There is one entrance and one exit, and you want to find the shortest path from the entrance to the exit.

A good analogy for counterfactual fairness is a court of law. The court tries to deliver justice by looking at what could have happened if different decisions were made. This is done by considering the evidence and making a determination based on that evidence. In machine learning, we try to do the same thing with algorithms. We want to make sure that the algorithm produces accurate results by exploring how it would have performed if different data was used or if certain assumptions about the data were not true.	counterfactual fairness	What analogy is used to explain counterfactual fairness (machine learning)?
The analogy to explain counterfactual fairness is the academic concept of “peer review”. In peer review, scholarly manuscripts are evaluated by a panel of experts in the same field as the author. The goal of this process is to identify flaws in the research and improve the quality of published work. In a similar way, machine learning models can be evaluated for their accuracy and fairness using counterfactual data.	counterfactual fairness	What analogy is used to explain counterfactual fairness (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy for counterfactual fairness is that it is like a courtroom. A fair trial requires that the defendant be given a chance to defend themselves, and that the jury be able to consider all of the evidence before making a decision. In order to ensure that these things happen, procedural fairness must be followed. This means that the rules of the court must be followed, including allowing both sides to present their case and questioning witnesses accordingly.	counterfactual fairness	What analogy is used to explain counterfactual fairness (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm may have a bias towards detecting one type of object over another, due to the particular training data that it has been exposed to. For example, if a machine learning algorithm is trained on pictures of cats and dogs, it may be more likely to detect a cat in an image than a dog.	coverage bias	What analogy is used to explain coverage bias (machine learning)?
A biased coin has a higher chance of landing on heads than tails. In the same way, a coverage bias in machine learning means that some datasets are more likely to be used in training models than others. This can create unfairness and inaccuracy in results.	coverage bias	What analogy is used to explain coverage bias (machine learning)?
One analogy for coverage bias is that it is like a person who only ever visits one side of the city. This person would have a skewed view of the city, as they would only know about one half of it. In the same way, when using machine learning algorithms, if you only ever use a dataset that is biased in some way (e.g. only includes data from men), your machine learning algorithm will be biased too.	coverage bias	What analogy is used to explain coverage bias (machine learning)?
A machine learning classifier is like a person who has been given a set of examples, and each time they see something new they have to decide which category it belongs in. If you keep giving the person new things to learn, their accuracy will improve over time. However, if you only give them old things to learn from (things that are already classified), then their accuracy will not improve as much.	coverage bias	What analogy is used to explain coverage bias (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain coverage bias is that it is like a person who only visits one side of the city. They will have a skewed view of the city because they are not seeing all sides.	coverage bias	What analogy is used to explain coverage bias (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is like a weed whacker. At first, you need to spend time carefully trimming the lawn so that the weed whacker can neatly cut the grass. But, after a while, you can just let the weed whacker go and it will mow the lawn for you.	crash blossom	What analogy is used to explain crash blossom (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is like a flower. It starts off as a tiny seed and, with the right conditions (i.e., data), it will grow and flourish. But if the environment is not conducive to its growth (i.e., bad data), the flower will wither and die.	crash blossom	What analogy is used to explain crash blossom (machine learning)?
A possible analogy for "crash blossom" would be if a person were learning how to drive a car and they consistently crashed into other cars on the road.	crash blossom	What analogy is used to explain crash blossom (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy for crash blossoms is that they are like a false positive in spam filtering. Just as spam filters can sometimes mistakenly identify legitimate messages as spam, machine learning algorithms can sometimes mistakenly identify benign data sets as malicious ones.	crash blossom	What analogy is used to explain crash blossom (machine learning)?
The machine learning analogy for crash blossom is a person who has been studying Spanish for years but still can't hold a conversation in the language. They may know all the words and how to use them, but when they try to speak aloud they make so many mistakes that others have trouble understanding them. In the same way, a machine learning algorithm may be able to correctly identify objects in pictures or predict outcomes of actions, but it will still make errors when applied to new data sets.	crash blossom	What analogy is used to explain crash blossom (machine learning)?
A critic in machine learning is a function that takes as input an agent's current state and action, and outputs a reward signal.	critic	What analogy is used to explain critic (machine learning)?

A critic is a machine learning algorithm that evaluates the performance of other machine learning algorithms.	critic	What analogy is used to explain critic (machine learning)?
Critic is a machine learning analogy used to explain how an artificial intelligence system can learn and improve its performance over time. A critic in this context refers to the part of the AI that evaluates its own performance and makes adjustments accordingly, much like a human critic would assess their own work and make changes where needed. The idea behind using a critic is that it allows for more accurate learning and improved performance as the AI system “self-corrects” its mistakes.	critic	What analogy is used to explain critic (machine learning)?
Cross-entropy is often explained using the example of two armies fighting each other. The goal of each army is to defeat the other, and as a result, their aim is to inflict as much damage on the enemy as possible. However, if both armies are firing blindly at each other with no strategy or plan whatsoever, they will achieve very little. This can be thought of as a situation where there is high entropy - that is, disorder and chaos. If, however, one army adopts a strategy (for example, focusing fire on the enemy's strongest units), it can reduce the entropy and make victory more likely. In this analogy, cross-entropy would represent the overall level of disorder in the system; reducing it would correspond to lower entropy	cross-entropy	What analogy is used to explain cross-entropy (machine learning)?
Cross-entropy is often explained using the example of two baristas, one who is a coffee expert and the other who knows nothing about coffee. The expert can make consistently great coffee, while the novice makes drinks with varying levels of success. If we asked these baristas to make a drink for someone who likes their coffee black but also happens to like it with cream and sugar, both would likely produce a drink that isn't quite right. The expert would make a drink that's too strong for someone who wants it sweetened, while the novice would make something too weak and without enough sweetness. In this analogy, cross-entropy would be represent by combining the preferences (black or sweetened) of the customer into one preference vector. The goal of either barista would then be to minimize cross-entropy between what they think the customer wants (based on their individual preference vectors) and what they actually want (a combined preference vector).	cross-entropy	What analogy is used to explain cross-entropy (machine learning)?
Cross entropy is a measure of how much information is lost when one variable is predicted from another. It can be thought of as the distance between two probability distributions.	cross-entropy	What analogy is used to explain cross-entropy (machine learning)?
Cross-entropy is similar to the concept of entropy in physics. In information theory, entropy is a measure of how much information is present in a message. It is also a measure of the uncertainty associated with that message. Cross-entropy measures the amount of uncertainty associated with two probability distributions.	cross-entropy	What analogy is used to explain cross-entropy (machine learning)?
Cross-entropy is often explained using the example of two tax collectors, one who collects taxes fairly and efficiently, and one who is corrupt and takes bribes. The first tax collector has a low cross-entropy because his job is simple and efficient. The second tax collector has a high cross-entropy because his job is much more complicated and filled with uncertainty.	cross-entropy	What analogy is used to explain cross-entropy (machine learning)?

In this analogy, the first week is akin to training data, while the second week is akin to validation data.	cross-validation	What analogy is used to explain cross-validation (machine learning)?
A machine learning technique used to estimate the accuracy of a predictor is cross-validation. In this technique, the data are divided into two parts: a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the predictor, and the test set is used to assess its accuracy.	cross-validation	What analogy is used to explain cross-validation (machine learning)?
The analogy is used to explain that cross-validation is similar to flipping a coin. When you flip a coin, you are trying to determine if the coin will land on heads or tails. You have a 50% chance of getting it right. Similarly, when you use cross-validation, you are trying to determine how well your model will perform on new data. You have a 50% chance of getting it right.	cross-validation	What analogy is used to explain cross-validation (machine learning)?
A machine learning practitioner might cross-validate a learning algorithm by splitting the data into two parts. One part is used to train the model, and the other part is used to test the model. This approach helps reduce bias in the models that are learned.	cross-validation	What analogy is used to explain cross-validation (machine learning)?
The analogy is used to explain how a machine learning algorithm works. The first step is to divide the data into two parts, training and testing. The training set will be used to teach the algorithm how to predict the correct answer, while the testing set will be used to see how well the algorithm can actually predict the answer.	cross-validation	What analogy is used to explain cross-validation (machine learning)?

However, with practice, you will be able to understand what people are saying and use the language yourself. The same is true for data analysis. It can be difficult to understand at first, but with practice you will be able to analyze data like a pro!	data analysis	What analogy is used to explain data analysis (machine learning)?
The analogy of data augmentation is that it is like stretching a rubber band. The more you stretch the rubber band, the more potential energy it has. Similarly, the more data you have to train your machine learning model, the better it will perform.	data augmentation	What analogy is used to explain data augmentation (machine learning)?
Asking a machine learning algorithm to learn from a small data set is like asking a person to learn everything they need to know about the world from only one book. To really understand what’s going on, you need lots of books—or data. Data augmentation is a technique used in machine learning algorithms to make sure they have enough varied data to learn from. It involves artificially adding new data points (e.g., images) that are similar but not identical to the original training set, in order to increase the size of the dataset and improve the quality of the learned models.	data augmentation	What analogy is used to explain data augmentation (machine learning)?
Analogy: Data augmentation is similar to a person’s brain increasing in size with age. The more data you have, the better your machine learning algorithm will perform.	data augmentation	What analogy is used to explain data augmentation (machine learning)?
The analogy of data augmentation is that it is like a fitness instructor. The fitness instructor helps people to improve their health and well-being by providing them with tailored advice and support.

In machine learning, it can be used to determine how accurately a machine can distinguish between different classes or types of data.	decision boundary	What analogy is used to explain decision boundary (machine learning)?
An analogy for a decision boundary in machine learning is that of an airport security checkpoint. The goal of the checkpoint is to determine which passengers can continue on their journey and which ones need to be further examined. This determination is made by looking at various attributes of each passenger, such as their age, sex, and luggage type. For example, all children under the age of 12 are allowed to proceed without being checked further, while all adults are automatically subjected to additional screening.	decision boundary	What analogy is used to explain decision boundary (machine learning)?

Just as someone approaching the edge of a cliff will hesitate before stepping over, so too will a machine learning algorithm hesitate before making a classification decision if it is unsure which category a particular input belongs to.	decision boundary	What analogy is used to explain decision boundary (machine learning)?
An analogy used to explain decision threshold is the act of crossing a bridge. A person has to decide when they are going to cross the bridge and once they have made that decision, there is no turning back.

The analogy of a threshold is used to explain decision threshold in machine learning. It is similar to when someone has to make a choice and decides what he or she wants by looking at the pros and cons of each option. The person needs to identify a point, or threshold, where they feel comfortable making a decision. In machine learning, this point is called the decision threshold. Algorithms are designed so that there is always some probability that an incorrect classification will be made; however, increasing the number of training examples generally decreases the error rate	decision threshold	What analogy is used to explain decision threshold (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain decision threshold is that it is the point at which a machine learning algorithm decides whether or not to classify an input as belonging to a certain category. If the threshold is set too high, then only inputs that are very clearly in or out of the category will be classified correctly. If the threshold is set too low, then more false positives (inputs that are incorrectly classified) will occur.	decision threshold	What analogy is used to explain decision threshold (machine learning)?
The analogy is that of a tree. The leaves (data instances) are input to the machine learning algorithm, which grows the tree by splitting the data instances into subsets based on how similar they are to one another.

A decision tree is used to explain machine learning as if it were a school subject. Just like in school, when you are first introduced to a new concept, you need someone to teach you what it is and how it works. With machine learning, a decision tree can be helpful in understanding the process of how machines learn on their own. The tree starts with the basics or inputs, then moves on to the decisions that are made based on those inputs, and finally explains the outputs that result from those decisions.	decision tree	What analogy is used to explain decision tree (machine learning)?
A decision tree is a bit like if you imagine your brain as a computer, and then you could break down each step of the thinking process that goes into making any decision - big or small.

The analogy used to explain demographic parity is that of two populations, one with a higher proportion of women and the other with a lower proportion. The assumption is that the populations are otherwise equal in all respects. If these groups were to have an election, the resulting vote would be 50/50 since each group has an equal chance of voting. This analogy can be applied to machine learning where there are two groups of data, one with more instances of a particular event (label) and another with less instances.

Just as each layer of a cake is baked separately and then stacked on top of one another, data is processed through successive layers of algorithms in order to learn from it.	depth	What analogy is used to explain depth (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy for a depthwise separable convolutional neural network is that it is like a series of interconnected simple switches. Each switch can be in one of two states, on or off, and each connection between switches can be either open (on) or closed (off).	depthwise separable convolutional neural network (sepcnn)	What analogy is used to explain depthwise separable convolutional neural network (sepcnn) (machine learning)?
A deep convolutional neural network can be seen as a stack of shallow networks, each with 3 layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer.	depthwise separable convolutional neural network (sepcnn)	What analogy is used to explain depthwise separable convolutional neural network (sepcnn) (machine learning)?
Depthwise separable convolutional neural networks (sepcnn) is similar to the way humans process information. The brain splits up visual information into different layers of processing, starting with the retina and working its way up to more complex areas like the visual cortex. This allows for more detailed analysis of an image as it’s being processed. A sepcnn operates in a similar way, by dividing input data into separate layers that are each analyzed independently. This results in a much deeper understanding of the data and better performance on certain tasks, such as object recognition or classification.	depthwise separable convolutional neural network (sepcnn)	What analogy is used to explain depthwise separable convolutional neural network (sepcnn) (machine learning)?
Analogy to a human brain: think of the sepcnn as having multiple, parallel "brains" that can each process data in a different way. This allows the network to learn features at different levels of abstraction, and helps it to generalize better to new data.	depthwise separable convolutional neural network (sepcnn)	What analogy is used to explain depthwise separable convolutional neural network (sepcnn) (machine learning)?
A sepcnn can be thought of as a 2D array where each neuron in the first dimension corresponds to an input image, and each neuron in the second dimension corresponds to a feature map. The network is trained by iteratively adjusting the weights so that activations at certain points in the input image produce desired outputs in the feature maps.	depthwise separable convolutional neural network (sepcnn)	What analogy is used to explain depthwise separable convolutional neural network (sepcnn) (machine learning)?
An analogy that is often used to explain dimension reduction in machine learning is the process of mailing a package. When you mail a package, you need to include information such as the recipient's name and address, the package's weight and dimensions, and any other relevant information. If you want to send multiple packages at once, however, it would be inefficient to include this same information on each individual package. Instead, you can create a shipping label that contains all of this information for all of the packages that you are sending. The shipping label takes up much less space than listing this information on each individual package.In the same way, dimension reduction in machine learning reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed by removing irrelevant features from your dataset. This makes it easier for your algorithm to find patterns in your data and results in faster performance.	dimension reduction	What analogy is used to explain dimension reduction (machine learning)?
A computer can be thought of as a very powerful microscope. Just as a microscope can zoom in on a small area of a slide to see details that are not visible to the naked eye, so too can computers analyze data at much finer resolutions than humans. However, just like it is impossible for a human to zoom in on every point on a slide, it is also impossible for computers to analyze all the data available to them. Dimension reduction is one way of reducing the number of points that need to be analyzed by the computer, and thereby speeding up the learning process.	dimension reduction	What analogy is used to explain dimension reduction (machine learning)?
The most common analogy is to think of data as a high-dimensional space, where each point in the space corresponds to a feature or characteristic of a particular observation. Reducing the dimensionality of this space means reducing the number of dimensions (features) that are used to represent it. This can be done by either selecting specific features that are important, or by using an algorithm such as principal component analysis (PCA) to compress the data into a lower-dimensional space.	dimension reduction	What analogy is used to explain dimension reduction (machine learning)?
Dimension reduction is a process where the number of dimensions in a dataset is reduced. This can be done through techniques such as feature selection or feature extraction.	dimension reduction	What analogy is used to explain dimension reduction (machine learning)?
dimension reduction is like a car mechanic taking your huge SUV and cutting it down to the size of a Smart Car. The mechanic keeps all the important features of your SUV—the engine, brakes, and suspension—but reduces the amount of space needed by shrinking the frame, body, and seats.	dimension reduction	What analogy is used to explain dimension reduction (machine learning)?
The analogy to explain dimensions is that they are like the different parts of a map. You can zoom in and out on a map to see more or less detail, depending on what you're interested in. The same is true with machine learning algorithms - you can use different dimensionalities to focus on different aspects of the data.	dimensions	What analogy is used to explain dimensions (machine learning)?
 Dimensions are used to explain machine learning in a manner similar to the way that dimensions are used to explain the universe. Just as there are three spatial dimensions and one time dimension, machine learning has three primary dimensions: data, algorithms, and models.	dimensions	What analogy is used to explain dimensions (machine learning)?
Machine learning can be thought of as a three-dimensional object. The first dimension is the number of training examples, or data points. The second dimension is the number of features or dimensions in the data. The third dimension is the complexity of the models that can be fit to the data.	dimensions	What analogy is used to explain dimensions (machine learning)?
The analogy of dimensions is used to explain how machine learning works. Just like in mathematics, where there are three dimensions (x, y and z), machine learning has different dimensions as well. In this analogy, the first dimension is the input data, which can be anything – images, text or numbers. The second dimension is the algorithm that processes the input data. And finally, the third dimension is the result of running the algorithm on the input data.	dimensions	What analogy is used to explain dimensions (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain dimensions is that it is like a train. You have the locomotive (the input), the boxcars (the features), and the caboose (the output). The more cars you add, the longer and heavier the train becomes.	dimensions	What analogy is used to explain dimensions (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a discriminative function, which takes in an input x and outputs a score y. The score is a measure of how likely it is that the input comes from one of the target classes.	discrete feature	What analogy is used to explain discrete feature (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a black box that takes an input (a set of data) and produces an output (a prediction or classification). The box has a number of knobs that you can turn to change the way it behaves. Each knob corresponds to a parameter in the algorithm.	discrete feature	What analogy is used to explain discrete feature (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a black box. You put in data, and the algorithm outputs a prediction. The black box analogy is useful because it emphasizes that we don’t always know what’s going on inside the machine learning algorithm.	discrete feature	What analogy is used to explain discrete feature (machine learning)?
The analogy that is often used to explain discrete feature machine learning is the process of sorting through a deck of cards. Imagine that you are looking for a specific card in the deck and need to sort through all 52 cards in order to find it. This would be difficult if the cards were jumbled together, but it becomes much easier if they are sorted into stacks of four, with each stack containing thirteen cards (the four suits plus the ace, two, three, four). In this case, you can easily find the card you are looking for by starting at the first stack and working your way through each one until you find the desired card.	discrete feature	What analogy is used to explain discrete feature (machine learning)?
An analogy that is often used to explain discrete features in machine learning is the example of a wine taster. A wine taster can taste the difference between different wines, and can identify certain flavors in a wine. This ability to detect small differences and identify specific flavors is similar to the way that machine learning algorithms can detect and learn from discrete features.	discrete feature	What analogy is used to explain discrete feature (machine learning)?
A discriminative model is a machine learning algorithm that is used to distinguish between different classes of objects. It can be used to identify the features that are most important in discriminating between different classes of objects.	discriminative model	What analogy is used to explain discriminative model (machine learning)?
A discriminative model is a machine learning model that can learn to distinguish between different categories of data. For example, you might use a discriminative model to learn to distinguish between pictures of dogs and cats.	discriminative model	What analogy is used to explain discriminative model (machine learning)?
A discriminative model is a bit like when you learn to recognize someone's face. Initially, your database of images will be a random assortment of faces. But after seeing the same person multiple times, your brain will start to form a representation (or "model") of that person's face. This model will allow you to discriminate between that person and others in your database, even if they are not wearing the same clothes or have slightly changed their hairstyle.	discriminative model	What analogy is used to explain discriminative model (machine learning)?
A discriminative model is best explained with an analogy to a human. When you first meet someone, you may not know much about them, but after getting to know them better, you can start to discriminate between the different aspects of their personality. For example, you may be able to distinguish between whether they are kind or mean, honest or dishonest, etc. In the same way, a discriminative machine learning model can learn how to discriminate between different types of data by observing examples of that data.	discriminative model	What analogy is used to explain discriminative model (machine learning)?
Trainers use positive reinforcement to increase the likelihood that a dog will display the desired behavior. The trainer typically rewards the dog with food or petting when it displays the desired behavior. This increases the chance that the dog will repeat the desired behavior, as it has been associated with a pleasing outcome.	discriminative model	What analogy is used to explain discriminative model (machine learning)?
A discriminator can be thought of as a machine learning function which takes two inputs, an image and a label, and outputs a probability that the image is of the given class.	discriminator	What analogy is used to explain discriminator (machine learning)?
The discriminator is likened to a human judge who must determine whether two pieces of art are by the same painter. The first painting is submitted to the judge, who evaluates it and determines whether it was created by the same artist as another painting that is already known to be from that artist. If the paintings are determined to be from the same artist, then the discriminator has learned how to distinguish between different paintings by that artist; if not, then it has not learned how to do so	discriminator	What analogy is used to explain discriminator (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain discriminator is a classifier in machine learning that can be used to distinguish between two classes of objects, for example, deciding whether an email is spam or not.	discriminator	What analogy is used to explain discriminator (machine learning)?
An analogy to discriminate between different types of objects is to think of a person who can quickly determine whether something is a bird or not. This person has learned what characteristics birds typically have (e.g., feathers, wings, beak) and can distinguish between birds and other objects by identifying these features. In the same way, a discriminator in machine learning is able to identify specific features within data that allow it to differentiate between different classes or categories of objects.	discriminator	What analogy is used to explain discriminator (machine learning)?
The discriminator is analogous to a human judge. It takes in two inputs, one from the classifier (the learner) and one from the real world, and decides whether they are the same or different.	discriminator	What analogy is used to explain discriminator (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy to disparate impact is when a computer is “learning” how to identify objects in pictures. If there are many examples of, say, dogs in the training set, then the computer will be very good at identifying dogs in new pictures. However, if there are few or no examples of cats in the training set, the computer will be poor at identifying cats in new pictures. This is analogous to disparate impact because it reflects how even seemingly minor differences (in this case, the number of dog vs cat images used for training) can lead to large disparities in performance (the ability to correctly identify dogs and cats).	disparate impact	What analogy is used to explain disparate impact (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy to disparate impact is that of a person trying to learn a new language. The person will initially have difficulty understanding all the words spoken, but with time and practice they will gradually be able to understand more and more.	disparate impact	What analogy is used to explain disparate impact (machine learning)?
Analogy: It is as if you are throwing a bunch of darts at a dartboard, and most of them are landing in the bullseye. However, every so often one of your darts lands way off to the side. This doesn’t mean that you are a terrible dart player; it just means that on this particular throw, luck was not on your side. In the same way, when machine learning algorithms are used to make predictions about something (such as whether or not someone will default on their loan), sometimes they will be accurate and sometimes they will be inaccurate. Just like with throwing darts, there is always some element of luck involved.	disparate impact	What analogy is used to explain disparate impact (machine learning)?
One analogy to explain disparate impact is the idea of a “machine learning algorithm”. If you have a large data set (inputs) and you want to find patterns in it, you can use a machine learning algorithm to do so. The algorithm will analyze all of the inputs and then look for patterns. It might learn, for example, that people who buy organic food also tend to buy certain other products. Disparate impact occurs when an artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithm has been trained on historic data that reflects bias (perhaps against women or minorities), and as a result, the algorithm produces outcomes that unfairly discriminate against those groups.	disparate impact	What analogy is used to explain disparate impact (machine learning)?
A good analogy for disparate impact is the way a vending machine works. The customer puts money into the machine and hits a button corresponding to the product they want. If there is only one of that product in the machine, it will come out no matter what. However, if there are multiple products of that type in the machine, then it takes more than one hit of the button to get the desired product. In other words, even if most people who put money in the machine only want one kind of candy bar, somebody who tries twice might get two different kinds.	disparate impact	What analogy is used to explain disparate impact (machine learning)?
The analogy that is used to explain disparate treatment is the example of a teacher. The teacher has different expectations for different students in the class. One student may be expected to get straight A's, while another student may only be expected to do average work.	disparate treatment	What analogy is used to explain disparate treatment (machine learning)?
A simple analogy to explain disparate treatment is to imagine you are an employer looking to hire two new employees. One of the candidates is a recent graduate from a prestigious university with an engineering degree. The other candidate worked odd jobs for the last four years to save money and has just completed a certification in welding. Even though both candidates may be equally qualified, it's likely that the employer would give preferential consideration to the candidate who graduated from the prestigious university because they appear more "reliable." This is an example of disparate treatment.	disparate treatment	What analogy is used to explain disparate treatment (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain disparate treatment is that it is the equivalent of a person who is looking for a job. The person goes to several job interviews, but only one company offers them a job. This person would then likely assume that the company who offered them the job was their best option and would be more likely to take the job they were offered. In machine learning, this would be analogous to a computer being taught how to recognize objects in pictures by being shown examples of different objects. After seeing enough examples, the computer will be better at recognizing objects in new pictures than if it had not been given any training data.	disparate treatment	What analogy is used to explain disparate treatment (machine learning)?
A person who is good at math may be compared to a machine learning algorithm. Just as the person can rapidly learn and perform complex calculations, the machine learning algorithm can rapidly learn and find patterns in data.	disparate treatment	What analogy is used to explain disparate treatment (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is like a recipe. You put in some ingredients (training data) and it outputs a result (a model). Just as with cooking, you can adjust the recipe to get different results. With machine learning, you can tweak the parameters of the algorithm to change how it learns from data.	disparate treatment	What analogy is used to explain disparate treatment (machine learning)?
An analogy to divisive clustering is that of a group of people. Initially, the group may be just one large entity. However, as time goes on, the group begins to break down into smaller and smaller groups based on similarities (common interests, beliefs, etc). These small groups are more efficient at performing tasks because they have like-minded individuals working together. This is similar to what happens with divisive clustering during machine learning; the algorithm begins by grouping all data points together but then slowly splits them up into more specific clusters.	divisive clustering	What analogy is used to explain divisive clustering (machine learning)?
The analogy of divisive clustering is the process of separating a group of people into smaller groups. In machine learning, this is done by finding clusters within a data set and then dividing the data set into increasingly smaller subsets based on those clusters. This allows machines to more accurately identify patterns and trends in large data sets.	divisive clustering	What analogy is used to explain divisive clustering (machine learning)?
One analogy for divisive clustering is that it is like sorting a bag of jelly beans. The first step is to divide the beans into groups based on their color. The second step is to put all of the red beans in one group, all of the blue beans in another group, and so on.	divisive clustering	What analogy is used to explain divisive clustering (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain divisive clustering is that of a group of friends. The first step in the process is to gather everyone together and have them stand in a large circle. The next step is to have each person in the group introduce themselves to their left-hand neighbor. After everyone has introduced themselves, the group should be divided into two smaller groups based on who people are closest to – their left-hand neighbors. Each new group will now be responsible for introducing themselves to their left-hand neighbor, and so on, until all members of the original group are part of two separate groups.	divisive clustering	What analogy is used to explain divisive clustering (machine learning)?
DIVisive CLustering (DCL) is a semi-supervised learning algorithm that can be used to automatically discover and group similar objects in data. It does so by constructing a model of the data, consisting of a number of k clusters, and then dividing the data into these clusters.	divisive clustering	What analogy is used to explain divisive clustering (machine learning)?
Downsampling is a technique used in machine learning for improving performance and accuracy. It works by reducing the number of training examples that are used to learn a model. This is done by selecting a smaller portion of the data set to be used for training, and then using this subset to train the model. The remaining data can then be used to evaluate the performance of the model.	downsampling	What analogy is used to explain downsampling (machine learning)?
Downsampling is similar to zooming in on a digital photo. The photo is still the same, but it is displayed at a smaller size. Downsampling works by reducing the number of data points used to represent a signal. This makes the representation faster and easier to work with, but it also reduces the quality of the signal.	downsampling	What analogy is used to explain downsampling (machine learning)?
It is often said that “machine learning is like a microscope, while deep learning is like an electron microscope.” With a microscope, you can see things in detail that are not visible to the naked eye. With an electron microscope, you can see even smaller details than with a regular microscope. In the same way, machine learning can identify patterns in data that are not detectable by humans. Deep learning can go one step further and identify very specific patterns within data	downsampling	What analogy is used to explain downsampling (machine learning)?
The zoom lens on a camera is an analogy for downsampling in machine learning. Just as the camera zooms in to capture more detail when you reduce the size of the image,downsampling in machine learning identifies and preserves important features from a large data set while eliminating redundant or irrelevant data.	downsampling	What analogy is used to explain downsampling (machine learning)?
Downsampling is a technique used in machine learning to reduce the size of training datasets. It works by selecting a small number of randomly-selected instances from the full dataset and using these as representative examples for the entire set. Downsampling can improve performance by reducing overfitting, and it also allows models to be trained more quickly.	downsampling	What analogy is used to explain downsampling (machine learning)?
A computer is like a brain. The computer takes in data (input), does some processing on it, and then outputs something.	dqn	What analogy is used to explain dqn (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a black box that takes an input (training data) and produces an output (a model). The model can then be used to predict the output for new data.	dqn	What analogy is used to explain dqn (machine learning)?
A computer is like a brain. It can learn how to do things by trying different things and seeing what works.	dqn	What analogy is used to explain dqn (machine learning)?
dqn is machine learning is similar to teaching a child how to ride a bicycle. At first, the child may not be able to pedal or stay on the bike for very long. But with practice, they will improve and eventually be able to ride their bike without assistance.	dqn	What analogy is used to explain dqn (machine learning)?
DQN is an acronym for deep Q-network, a machine learning algorithm used in artificial intelligence. The analogy used to explain DQN is that it is like a human playing video games. DQN remembers the game environment and how best to play given the current situation in order to maximize rewards.	dqn	What analogy is used to explain dqn (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain early stopping is that it is like a train. The further the train travels, the more information it has and the better its chances of making the right decision. However, if the train stops before it reaches its destination, it will not have all of the information and may make the wrong decision.	early stopping	What analogy is used to explain early stopping (machine learning)?
The analogy of early stopping is to think about a train. Imagine you are on a train and it's going very fast. If you tried to get off the train while it was moving, you would likely fall and get injured. However, if the train stopped suddenly, you would be able to safely get off without any trouble. This is similar to how early stopping works in machine learning; if the algorithm is stopped before it has reached overfitting, then the model will be improved.	early stopping	What analogy is used to explain early stopping (machine learning)?
If you are learning to play a new song on the guitar, and you get to the point where you can play most of it but there are a few sections that are still tricky, you might decide to stop practicing at that point. You would have "learned" enough of the song to be able to perform it reasonably well.	early stopping	What analogy is used to explain early stopping (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is like a human. It makes mistakes, but it can learn from its mistakes and get better over time.	early stopping	What analogy is used to explain early stopping (machine learning)?
Some students may analogyize early stopping in machine learning to a scenario in which they are watching a movie and decide to stop it after the first half-hour even if they have not yet seen the ending.	early stopping	What analogy is used to explain early stopping (machine learning)?
One analogy for EMD is that it is like the distance between two cities. If you want to travel from one city to another, you need to know how far apart they are. The same is true for machine learning algorithms - if you want to use one algorithm on data, you need to know how different the data is from the training set.	earth mover's distance (emd)	What analogy is used to explain earth mover's distance (emd) (machine learning)?
A possible analogy for EMD is the distance between two points on a map. The distance between two points can be computed by measuring the length of the line segment connecting them.	earth mover's distance (emd)	What analogy is used to explain earth mover's distance (emd) (machine learning)?
Earth Mover's Distance is a measure of how well one distribution can be transformed into another by moving balls around. It is used in machine learning to compare two distributions, for example the distribution of weights of training data points and the distribution of labels for those points.	earth mover's distance (emd)	What analogy is used to explain earth mover's distance (emd) (machine learning)?
The analogy of Emd is the same as saying “How far can a person travel in one day?” If you think about it, this is a pretty difficult question to answer. It would depend on many different factors like how fast the person walks, how long they stop for lunch, etc. The best we could do is give an estimate that takes into account some average values for these things. We could say something like “A person could walk about 10 miles in a day.” This might not be true for everyone, but it gives us a good idea of what to expect.Now imagine trying to answer the same question for a bulldozer. It would be much more complicated! We would need to know things like how fast the bulldozer can move, how big its tank is, and how long it can run without refueling. Even then, there are many other factors that would come into play like the terrain it was traveling over or whether there were any obstacles in its way.Just like with people, estimating distance traveled by earth movers involves taking into account lots of different variables. In machine learning terminology, this process is known as “emd calculation” or simply “emd estimation”	earth mover's distance (emd)	What analogy is used to explain earth mover's distance (emd) (machine learning)?
Earth Mover's Distance is used to calculate how much work is needed to move data from one point to another. The analogy would be like moving dirt from one pile to another. The further the distance, the more work that is required	earth mover's distance (emd)	What analogy is used to explain earth mover's distance (emd) (machine learning)?
Analogy: Embeddings are like places inside of a city. Streets (data points) run between intersections (embeddings) and can be thought of as the distance between two points.	embeddings	What analogy is used to explain embeddings (machine learning)?
An analogy is used to explain embeddings as a way of representing word meaning in machine learning. Words are like vectors in space, where each dimension corresponds to a different aspect of the word. For example, one dimension might represent how often the word appears in English text, while another dimension could represent its pronunciation.	embeddings	What analogy is used to explain embeddings (machine learning)?
An analogy to help explain embeddings is imagining a library. The books in the library are organized according to the Dewey Decimal System, which organizes books by topic. So, if you want to find a book on birds, you can go to the section on animals and look for the bird section. If you want to find a specific book on birds, such as The Birds of America, you can go straight to that section.Now imagine that the library decides to reorganize its books by color instead of topic. This would mean that all of the books on birds would be together in one place, regardless of what other topics they covered. It would also mean that there would be no sections on specific types of animals like birds or fish; instead, there would only be a general section on animals.Embeddings work in much the same way as this hypothetical library reorganization. Instead of organizing data by specific topics (like words), it isorganizedbyspecific attributes (like colors). This makes it easier for machines learning howto classify objects because they don't needto learnallthe different classifications separately - they can just learn howto group things together based on their attribute values.	embeddings	What analogy is used to explain embeddings (machine learning)?
An analogy for embeddings is to think of them as coordinates in a high-dimensional space. Just as we can plot points on a map using latitude and longitude, we can represent documents (or other data objects) in a high-dimensional vector space, where each dimension corresponds to an attribute or feature of the document.	embeddings	What analogy is used to explain embeddings (machine learning)?
Embeddings is a machine learning technique where data representing objects, such as words or concepts, are mapped to vectors of numbers.	embeddings	What analogy is used to explain embeddings (machine learning)?
The analogy of learning a new language is often used to explain the concept of embedding space in machine learning. Just as someone who wants to learn a foreign language must first learn the basics of grammar and vocabulary, a machine learning algorithm needs to be familiar with the basic structure of the data it is trying to learn in order to accurately predict outcomes. In other words, the more information an algorithm has about a set of data, the better it will be at predicting future events. This is where embedding space comes into play; by mapping relevant features of data onto a higher dimensional space, algorithms can extract more meaningful insights than would be possible if the data were kept in its original form.	embedding space	What analogy is used to explain embedding space (machine learning)?
An analogy that is often used to explain embedding space in machine learning is the idea of a map. Just as a physical map can be used to visualize relationships between different places, an embedding space can be used to visualize relationships between different entities (e.g. words, documents, or images) in a data set.	embedding space	What analogy is used to explain embedding space (machine learning)?
The analogy is that embedding space is like a map. The map can be used to find the location of specific places on the map, and it can also be used to find routes between different places on the map.	embedding space	What analogy is used to explain embedding space (machine learning)?
An analogy for embedding space is that it can be thought of as a map. The map has different colors to represent different areas, and each area is labeled with a specific name. If you wanted to find a specific location on the map, you could look up the name of the area and then find the corresponding spot on the map. Embedding space works in a similar way. It takes data points (like locations on a map) and assigns them unique identifiers (like colors or names). Then, it stores these identifiers together so that they can be easily accessed later. This makes it easy to find specific data points when you need them.	embedding space	What analogy is used to explain embedding space (machine learning)?
The analogy is used to explain how a machine learning algorithm can be "trained" on a set of input data, in order to predict the desired outputs. In the analogy, the space is imagined as a three-dimensional room, with each dimension corresponding to an input variable (x, y, and z). The training data is then embedded into this room (by plotting it), so that the algorithm can learn from it.	embedding space	What analogy is used to explain embedding space (machine learning)?
Erm is like a fitness function in evolutionary computation. The goal is to find the locally optimal solution that corresponds to the highest fitness value.	empirical risk minimization (erm)	What analogy is used to explain empirical risk minimization (erm) (machine learning)?
One analogy is that of a person in the market trying to minimize their risk. They may buy stocks in companies that they know and are familiar with, or invest in mutual funds that spread their money out over many different types of investments. This way, if one company fails, they haven't lost all their money.	empirical risk minimization (erm)	What analogy is used to explain empirical risk minimization (erm) (machine learning)?
Erm is the practice of reducing or eliminating as much risk as possible when making decisions. It can be thought of as a machine learning technique that allows for the identification and elimination of potential errors in data so that only accurate information is used to make predictions or determinations.	empirical risk minimization (erm)	What analogy is used to explain empirical risk minimization (erm) (machine learning)?
A decision-maker who is using empirical risk minimization (erm) is like a driver who wants to get from point A to point B as quickly and safely as possible. The driver will take into account all of the factors that can affect the journey, such as traffic, road conditions, and weather, in order to make the best decision for reaching their destination.	empirical risk minimization (erm)	What analogy is used to explain empirical risk minimization (erm) (machine learning)?
One analogy to explain ERM is the process of garbage collection. The garbage collector comes to your house every week and takes away your trash. Based on the schedule, it knows when your trash will fill up and so it arrives expecting a certain amount of garbage. If for some reason there is more or less trash than expected, then the garbage collector adjusts its route for next week accordingly. In a similar way, machine learning algorithms use past data to predict future events and then take actions accordingly in order to minimize risk (in this analogy, “risk” refers to error).	empirical risk minimization (erm)	What analogy is used to explain empirical risk minimization (erm) (machine learning)?
The encoder is like a student that is being taught how to read. The teacher is providing feedback on the student's performance so that they can learn and improve over time.	encoder	What analogy is used to explain encoder (machine learning)?
A computer is like a brain. It can be trained to recognize patterns in data, just like a human brain can learn to identify objects and faces.	encoder	What analogy is used to explain encoder (machine learning)?
Encoder is a machine learning model that takes an input (such as text) and transforms it into a representation of the underlying structure of the data.	encoder	What analogy is used to explain encoder (machine learning)?
The analogy is a computer program that can "learn" by example. It starts with a set of known examples, and then it tries to find patterns in the data. After it finds the patterns, it can use them to predict what will happen next based on new data.	encoder	What analogy is used to explain encoder (machine learning)?
Analogy: Encoder (machine learning) is like a student who is given a new topic to learn. The student will read about the topic, try to understand it, and then do exercises that apply what they learned.	encoder	What analogy is used to explain encoder (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain ensemble is that it is like a group of people working together. If each person only has a small amount of information, the group will not be able to do very much. However, if each person shares what they know with the rest of the group, the group will be able to accomplish more than each individual could on their own. This is similar to how machine learning works - by combining multiple models together, you can create a model that is more accurate than any individual model would be on its own.	ensemble	What analogy is used to explain ensemble (machine learning)?
When learning to play a new piece on the piano, you might first learn the notes one by one. This would be analogous to single-task learning. Once you have learned all of the individual notes in the piece, you can then start playing it with other people, which is analogous to ensemble (machine) learning.	ensemble	What analogy is used to explain ensemble (machine learning)?
A machine learning ensemble is like a group of people who are experts in different subjects. If you want to know something about a specific topic, you can ask one of the members of the ensemble for their opinion. However, if you want to get an accurate understanding of the topic, you should ask all of the members of the ensemble for their opinions.	ensemble	What analogy is used to explain ensemble (machine learning)?
One analogy that is commonly used to explain ensemble learning is the idea of “strength in numbers.” This analogy can be applied to many different situations, but often refers to the fact that a group of people or animals working together is typically stronger and more effective than a single person or animal working alone. This analogy can also be applied to machine learning algorithms – when multiple algorithms work together, they are able to produce better results than any individual algorithm could on its own.	ensemble	What analogy is used to explain ensemble (machine learning)?
An analogy used to explain ensemble learning is that it is similar to the human brain. The human brain is made up of many individual cells, called neurons. When these cells are put together, they create a network that can process information. This network can learn and make decisions based on the input it receives. Ensemble learning works in a similar way. It combines multiple algorithms together to create a network that can learn and make decisions based on the data it receives.	ensemble	What analogy is used to explain ensemble (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain environment (machine learning) is that it is like a new employee starting a job. In the beginning, the employee needs a lot of direction and support from their manager in order to do their job correctly. However, over time the employee becomes more familiar with the company's policies and procedures, and can work more independently. The same is true for machines - they need some guidance at first, but eventually they will be able to learn on their own and make better decisions.	environment	What analogy is used to explain environment (machine learning)?
Environment is being used as an analogy to explain machine learning. Just like how a person's environment shapes them, a machine's environment shapes it. The machine learns through its interactions with the world around it.	environment	What analogy is used to explain environment (machine learning)?
If you think of the environment as a machine learning "algorithm," then your input data would be the fuel. The more data you feed it, the better it becomes at recognizing patterns and making predictions.	environment	What analogy is used to explain environment (machine learning)?
The environment is like a teacher. The teacher provides feedback to the student on how well they are doing.	environment	What analogy is used to explain environment (machine learning)?
The machine learning environment is usually compared to a casino. In a casino, there are many different games that people can play. Some of these games are designed to be won by the player, while others are designed so that the house always wins in the long run. The same is true for machine learning environments - some algorithms are designed to be more accurate than others, and some datasets are easier to learn from than others.	environment	What analogy is used to explain environment (machine learning)?
Episode is used as an analogy to explain machine learning in the context of a conversation. In this analogy, each time you have a conversation with someone, you are learning new things about them and their interests. Over time, your understanding of this person gets better and better, allowing you to carry on more meaningful conversations with them. Machine learning works in a similar way - it allows computers to learn from data over time, improving their ability to understand and predict outcomes.	episode	What analogy is used to explain episode (machine learning)?
Episode is machine learning can be thought of as a journey. During this journey, the computer is constantly learning and making predictions about future events. Every time it encounters a new situation or problem, it analyzes past data in order to make the best possible decision.	episode	What analogy is used to explain episode (machine learning)?
Episode is machine learning analogy is used to explain episode. It's like a new person joins your company and in the first day they are given a tour of the office, introduced to everyone, and shown their desk. In the second day, the new person is given a task to do. The third day, the new person continues working on their task from day two but also starts asking questions about how things work and talking with their coworkers. By the fourth day, the new person has figured out what they need to do and where they fit into the company.	episode	What analogy is used to explain episode (machine learning)?
Episode is like a journey. In the beginning, you don't know what to expect and you are unsure of yourself. The further you go, the more confident you become and the better equipped you are to handle whatever comes your way. Along the way, there will be setbacks and challenges, but with each experience, you learn something new that helps make you stronger and better prepared for what's ahead.	episode	What analogy is used to explain episode (machine learning)?
Episode is often compared to a machine learning model. Just as a machine learning model "learns" by adjusting its weights and parameters in response to data, an episode "learns" by modifying its internal state in response to experience.	episode	What analogy is used to explain episode (machine learning)?
The epsilon greedy policy is explained using the analogy of a prospector. A prospector always searches for gold, but sometimes he finds nothing. However, he continues to search because the potential payoff (finding gold) is so great. The epsilon greedy policy works in a similar way: it keeps searching for better solutions even if the current solution is not perfect.	epsilon greedy policy	What analogy is used to explain epsilon greedy policy (machine learning)?
The Epsilon Greedy policy is a machine learning algorithm that works by randomly selecting a fraction (epsilon) of the data points to be used for each iteration of the optimization algorithm.	epsilon greedy policy	What analogy is used to explain epsilon greedy policy (machine learning)?
The Epsilon Greedy algorithm is a policy gradient algorithm that uses an epsilon parameter to control the size of the step size. This means that it will only explore a small fraction of the search space in each iteration, but will gradually increase the size of this exploration as it gets closer to the optimum.	epsilon greedy policy	What analogy is used to explain epsilon greedy policy (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain the epsilon greedy policy is that it is like a fisherman who gradually increases the size of his net as he catches more and more fish. With each catch, the fisherman gets closer and closer to catching the exact type of fish he wants. The epsilon greedy policy in machine learning works in a similar way. It starts with a small “epsilon” value and then gradually increases it until the algorithm finds the best solution possible.	epsilon greedy policy	What analogy is used to explain epsilon greedy policy (machine learning)?
The analogy is that of a mugger who asks for a small amount of cash from his victim, rather than trying to grab all the cash he can. The epsilon greedy policy in machine learning searches through a set of options to find the best one while keeping close to the current best option, like how the mugger keeps close to his victim.	epsilon greedy policy	What analogy is used to explain epsilon greedy policy (machine learning)?
The analogy for equality of opportunity is that it is like a machine learning. In both cases, there are input and output variables, but the exact path from input to output cannot be predicted in advance.	equality of opportunity	What analogy is used to explain equality of opportunity (machine learning)?
An analogy that is often used to explain equality of opportunity in machine learning is the lottery. In a lottery, everyone has an equal chance of winning, regardless of their wealth or social status. This is analogous to how machine learning works – all data (including training data) is treated equally, and no pre-existing biases are introduced into the system.	equality of opportunity	What analogy is used to explain equality of opportunity (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy to help explain equality of opportunity is using a car factory as an example. In this analogy, the car factory is the environment in which opportunities are available. The workers in the factory have an equal opportunity to learn how to build cars. Some workers may be naturally better at it than others, but all of them have access to the same resources and can improve their skills with practice.	equality of opportunity	What analogy is used to explain equality of opportunity (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy used to explain equality of opportunity is that everyone has an equal opportunity to use the machine.

N/A	equalized odds	What analogy is used to explain equalized odds (machine learning)?
The analogy of equalized odds is using a slot machine in Las Vegas. The odds of hitting the jackpot on any individual pull are astronomically small, but over time the house edge ensures that the casino will make money. In the same way, a machine learning algorithm may have low chances of correctly predicting an outcome on any given trial, but with enough data its predictions will be more accurate than chance alone.	equalized odds	What analogy is used to explain equalized odds (machine learning)?
One analogy to explain equalized odds is betting on a roulette wheel. Just as the odds of any particular bet are always the same, regardless of where it is placed on the wheel, so too are the odds for each class in a machine-learning problem always the same, no matter where it appears in the training data.	equalized odds	What analogy is used to explain equalized odds (machine learning)?
The analogy of equalized odds is that it is the same as flipping a coin. No matter how many times you flip a coin, the odds are always 50/50 of getting heads or tails.	equalized odds	What analogy is used to explain equalized odds (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain equalized odds is flipping a coin. The odds of obtaining heads or tails are always the same, 50/50.	equalized odds	What analogy is used to explain equalized odds (machine learning)?
The machine learning analogy is used to explain how a computer can be taught to learn without being explicitly programmed. In the analogy, a human is like a computer and the teacher is like the machine learning algorithm. The human brain is like the computer's memory and the experiences that the person has are like the data that is fed into the machine learning algorithm. Just as the teacher helps the student learn over time, so does the machine learning algorithm help improve the accuracy of predictions by adjusting its parameters according to feedback from examples.	example	What analogy is used to explain example (machine learning)?
One analogy used to explain machine learning is that it’s like a child learning how to speak. A baby doesn’t know how to talk at first, but through experience and exposure, the child gradually starts to learn the language. With machine learning, computers start with no knowledge of the task at hand, but they can be taught by example what to do. They then continue to learn and get better over time as they are exposed to more data.	example	What analogy is used to explain example (machine learning)?
A decision tree is like a flowchart. It helps to visualize the different paths that your data can take as it flows through your machine learning algorithm.	example	What analogy is used to explain example (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is like a fitness routine. The more you use it, the better your results will be.	example	What analogy is used to explain example (machine learning)?
A student is in a classroom. A teacher is giving a lecture on a topic that the student does not understand. The student takes notes on everything the teacher says, and then goes home to study their notes. If they continue this process, they will eventually learn the material being covered in class.	example	What analogy is used to explain example (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain experience replay is that it is like a person watching a movie. The person watches the movie again and again, each time taking in different information.	experience replay	What analogy is used to explain experience replay (machine learning)?
The analogy is of a person watching a movie. The first time they watch it, they pay attention to the plot and what is happening. The second time, they can focus on other things because they know what is going to happen.	experience replay	What analogy is used to explain experience replay (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is like a person that learns how to ride a bike by practicing. The first time they try, they might fall off a lot. But eventually, after enough practice, they'll be able to ride the bike without falling. The same thing happens with machine learning algorithms. They learn by trying different things and seeing what works best	experience replay	What analogy is used to explain experience replay (machine learning)?

Then, when they watch the movie again, they can remember what happened because they already know what to expect.	experience replay	What analogy is used to explain experience replay (machine learning)?
An analogy used to explain experience replay is a student studying for an exam. The student reviews past exams and notes to help prepare for the upcoming test. In a similar way, experience replay helps a machine learning algorithm remember past experiences so it can make better decisions in the future.	experience replay	What analogy is used to explain experience replay (machine learning)?
The analogy is that the experimenter is a human and humans are biased.	experimenter's bias	What analogy is used to explain experimenter's bias (machine learning)?
The analogy of experimenter's bias is often compared to that of a person who has a favorite child. The person may unconsciously be biased towards their favorite child, which could lead to them being inaccurate in their observations and assessments of the other children. In the same way, an experimenter's bias can cause them to unintentionally favor one result over another while analyzing data from a machine learning algorithm.	experimenter's bias	What analogy is used to explain experimenter's bias (machine learning)?
There is a bias in the machine learning process that can be introduced by the person conducting the experiment. This bias is often called an "experimenter's bias." It occurs when the experimenter inadvertently influences the results of an experiment through subtle cues or expectations.	experimenter's bias	What analogy is used to explain experimenter's bias (machine learning)?
The analogy is that the experimenter's bias is like a human being reading a book. The person might be biased in their understanding of what they are reading based on their own personal biases or preconceptions. In the same way, machine learning can be biased if the algorithms used to analyze data are not neutral.	experimenter's bias	What analogy is used to explain experimenter's bias (machine learning)?
One analogy used to explain experimenter's bias is that of a person who has pre-determined expectations for an outcome of a coin flip, and therefore may subconsciously influence the result.	experimenter's bias	What analogy is used to explain experimenter's bias (machine learning)?
The analogy of the sieve is often used to explain the exploding gradient problem. Imagine you are trying to separate a bag of sand into its individual grains. You can do this by pouring the sand through a mesh screen with small holes. The bigger pieces of sand will be stopped by the mesh, while the smaller pieces will fall through and accumulate on the other side. If you then try to pour the small pieces back through the screen, they will quickly fill up all of the space between the larger pieces and make it impossible for them to pass through. This is analogous to what happens with neural networks during backpropagation: as we reduce the size of our error signal (by moving closer to convergence), smaller and smaller corrections are made, eventually leading to saturation where no more changes can be made.	exploding gradient problem	What analogy is used to explain exploding gradient problem (machine learning)?
It is often said that gradient descent learning can be thought of as trying to climb a mountain. The lower the altitude of the starting point, the easier it will be to ascend. In machine learning, this analogy can be taken one step further: if you imagine the mountain as having different slopes (or gradients), then it is clear that steep hills would be more difficult to climb than gentle ones. This is exactly what happens during gradient descent: we are constantly adjusting our current position in order to find the lowest point on the “altitude” curve (the error surface).	exploding gradient problem	What analogy is used to explain exploding gradient problem (machine learning)?
The analogy is used to explain that a machine learning algorithm can "learn" how to do something by trial and error, but if it's given too many incorrect answers in a row, it will eventually give up and stop trying.	exploding gradient problem	What analogy is used to explain exploding gradient problem (machine learning)?
The analogy is that of a balloon. If you keep blowing up a balloon, eventually the latex will stretch too thin and it will burst. The same principle applies to gradient descent; if you increase the learning rate too much, the algorithm will overshoot the optimum point and converge on a sub-optimal solution.	exploding gradient problem	What analogy is used to explain exploding gradient problem (machine learning)?
The analogy of the gradient descent problem is that it is like hiking down a mountain. As you hike, you constantly check your altitude to ensure that you are still going downhill. If not, you adjust your path accordingly. The same principle applies to machine learning – we want our algorithm to constantly be adjusting its direction (or gradient) so that it can learn as quickly and efficiently as possible.	exploding gradient problem	What analogy is used to explain exploding gradient problem (machine learning)?
A common analogy used to explain fairness constraint in machine learning is the notion of a “equal playing field.” In this analogy, each individual has an opportunity to compete on equal footing, regardless of their personal characteristics (e.g., race, gender, etc.). This allows for a merit-based evaluation where the best individuals are ultimately selected.	fairness constraint	What analogy is used to explain fairness constraint (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is like a Muse musician. They can play any song perfectly, but they are constrained by the notes that are available to them.	fairness constraint	What analogy is used to explain fairness constraint (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain the fairness constraint in machine learning is if you have a classroom of students and are trying to teach them, but some students keep falling asleep, then the teacher has to adjust the teaching methods so that all students can learn. In the same way, a machine learning algorithm needs to be adjusted so that it does not unfairly advantage or disadvantage certain groups of people.	fairness constraint	What analogy is used to explain fairness constraint (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is like a judge who has to make a decision based on the evidence provided. The fairness constraint ensures that all members of the population have an equal chance of being treated fairly by the algorithm, regardless of their personal characteristics such as race, gender or socio-economic status.	fairness constraint	What analogy is used to explain fairness constraint (machine learning)?
The analogy is that the machine learning algorithm is like a teacher. It gives feedback to the student on how well they are doing and adjusts the difficulty of the task accordingly.	fairness constraint	What analogy is used to explain fairness constraint (machine learning)?
A fairness metric is like a ruler that measures how evenly something is distributed.	fairness metric	What analogy is used to explain fairness metric (machine learning)?
One analogy is to think of fairness in machine learning as being a bit like being a juror. A juror has to weigh the evidence and decide what they believe is fair based on that information, similarly with machine learning we need to define what fairness means for our data and algorithms.	fairness metric	What analogy is used to explain fairness metric (machine learning)?
One analogy can be made to the field of statistics, where one would use a p-value in order to calculate how likely it is that an observed result was due to chance. In a similar way, a fairness metric measures how likely it is that an observed outcome was due to some unfair process.	fairness metric	What analogy is used to explain fairness metric (machine learning)?
A fairness metric is the equivalent of a ruler for measuring the fairness of an algorithm. Just as a ruler can be used to measure the length of a piece of paper, a fairness metric can be used to measure how fair an algorithm is.	fairness metric	What analogy is used to explain fairness metric (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain fairness metric (machine learning) is that of a courtroom. In order for a jury to be fair, they need to be unbiased and represent the population that they are serving. This can be done by randomly selecting jurors from the population or by using some other measure of representativeness.	fairness metric	What analogy is used to explain fairness metric (machine learning)?
The analogy of federated learning is the comparison to a school district. A school district is made up of many individual schools that each have their own curriculum and teach different things. However, the school district still has a central office that oversees everything and makes sure it all runs smoothly. In the same way, federated learning is when many individual machines learn on their own, but there is still a central machine (or server) that oversees everything and makes sure it all runs smoothly.	federated learning	What analogy is used to explain federated learning (machine learning)?
Federated learning is the process of training a model on multiple devices without sending any data to a central server. This can be done by partitioning the data among different devices, and then each device trains its own model using only the local data. Once all the models are trained, they can be combined into a single model using some form of consensus algorithm.	federated learning	What analogy is used to explain federated learning (machine learning)?
A federated learning analogy is a classroom of students. Each student has their own notebook in which they take notes during the class. At the end of the class, each student takes their notebook and leaves. The teacher then collects all of the notebooks and reviews all of the notes from all of the students to get an idea of what was learned in class that day. Federated learning is similar in that instead of having one computer learn from data, many computers learn from data - often spread out across different geographical areas.	federated learning	What analogy is used to explain federated learning (machine learning)?
Federated learning is often described as a “machine learning puzzle.” Imagine you have 100 photos of dogs, and you want to create a model that can identify pictures of dogs. You could do this by training a model on all 100 photos, but that would require downloading all the data, storing it, and then using it to make predictions. Or you could break the problem into smaller pieces. You could divide the data into 10 groups of 10 images each, train a model on each group, and then merge the models together to create one dog-identifying machine learning model. This approach is called federated learning because different computers (or devices) are used to learn from small parts of the data set independently before coming together (federating) to form one big machine learning model.	federated learning	What analogy is used to explain federated learning (machine learning)?
The analogy of federated learning is that it is similar to a library. A library has many different books from different authors, but all the books are housed in the same place. In federated learning, many different computers (or "books") are used to learn a task, but all the learning takes place centrally.	federated learning	What analogy is used to explain federated learning (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain a feedback loop (machine learning) is that it is similar to a thermostat in your home. The thermostat senses the temperature of the room and then makes small adjustments to the furnace so that the desired temperature is maintained. A feedback loop (machine learning) also senses input data, adjusts its algorithms accordingly, and then outputs results which are compared against the original input data. If there is a discrepancy, then the feedback loop (machine learning) will adjust its algorithms again until it produces results that are closer to those originally desired.	feedback loop	What analogy is used to explain feedback loop (machine learning)?
Machine learning is like a thermostat. It learns what temperature you prefer and then makes small adjustments to the furnace in order to reach that target temperature more quickly.	feedback loop	What analogy is used to explain feedback loop (machine learning)?
A machine learning feedback loop analogy is similar to a thermostat in your home. The thermostat reads the air temperature and turns on or off the furnace based on whether it is too hot or cold in the house. In this analogy, the input would be the current air temperature, and the output would be whether or not to turn on the furnace. We can also think of our thermostat as being “trained” over time – it learns what temperatures are comfortable for us and makes predictions about future temperaturesbased on past readings.	feedback loop	What analogy is used to explain feedback loop (machine learning)?
A machine learning feedback loop is similar to a thermostat in your house. By sensing the room temperature, the thermostat can turn on or off the furnace to maintain the desired temperature. In a similar way, a machine learning system can use feedback from its past experiences to improve its future performance.	feedback loop	What analogy is used to explain feedback loop (machine learning)?
A feedback loop is a machine learning analogy that is used to explain how a computer system “learns” from data. A feedback loop consists of three parts: the target or outcome, the prediction, and the error. In order for a computer system to improve its predictions, it needs access to data that has been labeled with the correct outcomes. This data is then used to calculate the error between the predicted value and the actual value. The computer system can then use this information to adjust its predictions in future iterations.	feedback loop	What analogy is used to explain feedback loop (machine learning)?
A feedforward neural network is a machine learning algorithm that can be used to model complex patterns in data. It works by taking an input, processing it through a series of hidden layers, and then outputting the result.	feedforward neural network (ffn)	What analogy is used to explain feedforward neural network (ffn) (machine learning)?
Affn (machine learning) is often compared to the human brain. The ffN (machine learning) accepts an input, such as a photograph, and attempts to learn how to recognize that object in the future. This is similar to how humans learn; we are constantly exposed to new objects and experiences and eventually learn how to identify them.	feedforward neural network (ffn)	What analogy is used to explain feedforward neural network (ffn) (machine learning)?
A feedforward neural network is a bit like the human brain. The input layer of neurons accepts signals from the outside world, such as sights and sounds. These signals are processed by the hidden layers of neurons, which in turn send outputs to the final layer of neurons, where they are interpreted as decisions or actions.	feedforward neural network (ffn)	What analogy is used to explain feedforward neural network (ffn) (machine learning)?
The analogy is that of a person reading instructions for assembling a toy. The person reads the instructions once, and then assembles the toy according to the instructions. The next time the person assembles the same toy, they will likely be able to do so more quickly, as they have less need to refer back to the instructions. This is analogous to how an ffn "learns" - it observes examples of input/output pairs, and builds up a model of how best to produce outputs given particular inputs.	feedforward neural network (ffn)	What analogy is used to explain feedforward neural network (ffn) (machine learning)?
An analogy to help explain a feedforward neural network is that it is somewhat like the human brain. The input enters the ffnet through the neurons on the left side of the figure, passes through one or more hidden layers (not shown), and then outputs activate other neurons on the right side of the figure. Each neuron within a layer connects to every neuron in the subsequent layer.	feedforward neural network (ffn)	What analogy is used to explain feedforward neural network (ffn) (machine learning)?
Using a few examples to learn how to do something is an example of few-shot learning. For instance, if you want to learn how to play a new game, you might need just a few rounds of playing it to understand the basic rules.	few-shot learning	What analogy is used to explain few-shot learning (machine learning)?
Machine learning is like how humans learn. A baby starts with no knowledge, and then learns from experiences (few-shot learning).	few-shot learning	What analogy is used to explain few-shot learning (machine learning)?
few-shot learning is similar to teaching a child how to recognize different types of animals. At first, the child may only be able to identify a few animal species, but after repeated exposures to different animals, the child will eventually learn how to recognize all kinds of animals. The same principle applies to machine learning algorithms – after being exposed to a limited number of training examples, these algorithms can eventually learn how to classify new data instances with high accuracy.	few-shot learning	What analogy is used to explain few-shot learning (machine learning)?
Analogy: Learning to ride a bike. Initially, it is difficult because there are so many new things to remember and control. After a few falls and crashes, however, the task becomes easier as you learn what works and what doesn't.	few-shot learning	What analogy is used to explain few-shot learning (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain few-shot learning is that it is similar to humans learning new words. Initially, the human may only know a few definitions of the word, but after hearing the word multiple times in different contexts, they will eventually learn its meaning. The same principle applies to machine learning algorithms - they can learn new concepts after being presented with just a few examples.	few-shot learning	What analogy is used to explain few-shot learning (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy for fine tuning is the tuning of a guitar. Just as with a guitar, if the knobs on a machine learning model are not set just right, the results will be inaccurate. It takes some experimentation and tweaking to get the settings just right so that the desired outcome is achieved.	fine tuning	What analogy is used to explain fine tuning (machine learning)?
The analogy of a machine learning algorithm being "tuned up" is often used in the machine learning community. Just as an engine needs to be tuned to run smoothly and achieve its highest performance, a machine learning algorithm needs to be tuned for best results. This tuning process usually involves adjusting various parameters, such as the number of iterations or the amount of data used for training, until the desired performance is achieved.	fine tuning	What analogy is used to explain fine tuning (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain fine tuning is that of a machine learning. Just as a machine needs to be finely tuned in order to function correctly, so too does the algorithm behind machine learning need to be finely tuned in order for it to accurately learn from data.	fine tuning	What analogy is used to explain fine tuning (machine learning)?
It is sometimes said that, in the same way that tuning a piano involves adjusting many small levers to create just the right notes, so too fine-tuning a machine learning algorithm requires making many small tweaks to get it working well.	fine tuning	What analogy is used to explain fine tuning (machine learning)?
It is as if you have a machine with many dials that must be finely tuned in order for the machine to work. If one dial is even slightly off, the entire machine will not function correctly. The same is true for machine learning; the algorithms and parameters involved must be carefully set in order for the system to learn effectively.	fine tuning	What analogy is used to explain fine tuning (machine learning)?
A forget gate is a type of memory cell used in machine learning. It allows a machine to "forget" information that it has learned, so that it can learn new information more effectively. This analogy compares the forget gate to a person's short-term memory. When we learn something new, we often forget some of what we learned previously. The forget gate allows machines to do the same thing - to remember and learn new information more effectively.	forget gate	What analogy is used to explain forget gate (machine learning)?
A forget gate is a machine learning analogy that is used to help explain how a neural network can "forget" information. The analogy likens a neural network to an office worker who has several tasks to remember during the workday. At the end of the day, the worker may forget some of the tasks that were assigned to them. This forgetting is similar to what happens in a neural network; as new information is presented, older information may be forgotten.	forget gate	What analogy is used to explain forget gate (machine learning)?
Forget gate (machine learning) is like a garbage disposal. You can put all kinds of things in it and it will chew them up and spit them out, hopefully in a more usable form than when they went in.	forget gate	What analogy is used to explain forget gate (machine learning)?
Analogy: The forget gate is like a computer that has been turned off. If you want to remember something, you have to keep turning on the computer by activating the forget gate.	forget gate	What analogy is used to explain forget gate (machine learning)?

The analogy is used to explain how a machine learning algorithm works with a group of input variables. The input variables are like flowers in a garden, and the algorithm is like a bee that collects nectar from the flowers. After visiting several flowers, the bee can return to its hive and tell other bees which flowers are worth visiting because they have the most nectar.	full softmax	What analogy is used to explain full softmax (machine learning)?
One analogy used to explain full softmax is that it’s like a group of people all trying to guess the outcome of a particular event, such as the winner of the Super Bowl. Each person in the group makes their best guess and then those guesses are tallied. The person with the most correct guesses is considered to be the “winner” of this mini-contest. In machine learning terms, this would correspond to taking a set of predictions from a neural network and then using them to calculate an overall accuracy score.	full softmax	What analogy is used to explain full softmax (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy for softmax is that it is like a group of people each holding up one number card, ranging from 1 to 10. The cards are turned over one at a time and the total value shown is announced. For example, if the first three cards revealed were 3, 5, and 7 then the sum would be 15. After all of the cards have been turned over, the person with the card representing the highest value (10 in this case) would be declared the winner.	full softmax	What analogy is used to explain full softmax (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy for Softmax would be a group of people each holding a different color balloon. They are asked to show their balloons one at a time and the person who shows the yellow balloon is declared the winner. In order to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to show their balloon, when it's not that person's turn they must hold their balloon up so everyone can see it.	full softmax	What analogy is used to explain full softmax (machine learning)?
A fully connected layer is a type of artificial neural network. It's made up of neurons, or nodes, that are all interconnected. This allows the network to learn complex patterns and relationships between data points.	fully connected layer	What analogy is used to explain fully connected layer (machine learning)?
One analogy to help understand fully connected layers is as follows: imagine you have a very large jigsaw puzzle, with many pieces. You dump all the pieces out on a table and start putting them together. At first, the task seems daunting, but eventually you get into a groove and the individual pieces start to come together. As more and more pieces fall into place, your picture becomes clearer and clearer. This is analogous to how neurons in a layer are interconnected; as each neuron “fires” (i.e., sends an input signal), it helps to clarify the picture (or decision) being formed by the other neurons in that layer.	fully connected layer	What analogy is used to explain fully connected layer (machine learning)?
A fully connected layer is a neural network layer in which each neuron connects to every other neuron in the previous layer.	fully connected layer	What analogy is used to explain fully connected layer (machine learning)?
A neural network is like a group of neurons in the brain. Each neuron receives input from other neurons, and sends outputs to still other neurons.

The analogy used to explain machine learning is that of a person being taught how to play chess. Just as a person can be taught the game of chess and eventually become good at it, a machine can also be taught how to play chess (by being fed lots of data) and eventually become good at it too.	gan	What analogy is used to explain gan (machine learning)?

A person who is learning to speak a foreign language may be given many examples of how a particular word is used. With enough exposure, the person will gradually learn how to use the word themselves.

This process of teaching computers to learn on their own is called machine learning or gan.	gan	What analogy is used to explain gan (machine learning)?
The analogy that is often used to explain gan (machine learning) is the black box analogy. In this analogy, the machine learning algorithm is represented by a black box.

The human mind starts with a limited amount of information and experiences, but through generalization it can learn to make predictions about new situations.	generalization	What analogy is used to explain generalization (machine learning)?
One analogy is that of learning to play a piano. At first, you may only know how to play a few basic chords, but with practice you can eventually learn to play any song. The more songs you learn, the easier it becomes to learn new ones. This is because you are able to generalize from the songs you already know how to play. In machine learning, generalization is when a system learns from past experience and is able to apply what it has learned to new situations.	generalization	What analogy is used to explain generalization (machine learning)?
One analogy to help understand generalization is imagine you are a teacher. You might teach your students the different states in the United States. Over time, you may notice that some of your students know more about the states than others. The students who know more likely learned from other teachers or did additional research on their own outside of class. This is an example of generalization; when machine learning algorithms learn from specific examples (the students), and then apply what they learned to other similar examples (other teachers or research).	generalization	What analogy is used to explain generalization (machine learning)?

Analogy used to explain generalization curve (machine learning):When you learn how to drive a car, at first everything is new - the gear stick, the pedals, the steering wheel. Over time though, you learn how each of these controls affect the car and what each one does. As a result your ability to control the car improves and you can drive it better and faster. The same thing happens with machine learning algorithms - they start off being not very good at doing anything, but as they "learn" more about the data they are given, their performance improves.	generalization curve	What analogy is used to explain generalization curve (machine learning)?
This analogy uses the terms “training” and “testing.” During training, data is fed into a learning algorithm so that it can learn how to recognize patterns. The testing phase occurs once the learning algorithm has been trained; in this step, the algorithm is applied to new data in order to determine how well it performs. In generalization curve plotting, the x-axis represents the number of instances used for training, while the y-axis reflects performance (i.e., accuracy) on a held-out set of test data.	generalization curve	What analogy is used to explain generalization curve (machine learning)?
The analogy is that of a child learning the alphabet. Initially, the child learns only a few letters. With time and practice, they learn more and more letters until they can read fluently.	generalization curve	What analogy is used to explain generalization curve (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain the generalization curve is that of a person's experience when learning to drive. Initially, when a learner starts driving, they are very cautious and make few mistakes. As they continue to drive more, they become more confident and make fewer errors. Eventually, they reach a point where they can drive safely without making any mistakes at all (this is the generalized state). However, if the driver stops practicing for an extended period of time, their skills will eventually degrade and they will start making more mistakes again.	generalization curve	What analogy is used to explain generalization curve (machine learning)?
In machine learning, a generalization curve is a graph that displays how well a machine learning algorithm performs on different data sets. The x-axis of the graph represents the size of the data set, while the y-axis represents how accurately the machine learning algorithm predicts the correct labels for each data point in the set.	generalization curve	What analogy is used to explain generalization curve (machine learning)?

An analogy used to explain generalized linear model is that of a train. The tracks on which the train runs can be thought of as representing the features, while the distance traveled by the train can be thought of as representing the outcome (label).	generalized linear model	What analogy is used to explain generalized linear model (machine learning)?
The analogy of a funnel is often used to explain the concept of a generalized linear model in machine learning. The top of the funnel represents all of the data that is available, while the bottom of the funnel represents the data that is actually used for training and prediction. In between, there are various stages where different types of processing are applied, resulting in a smaller and more manageable set of data that is used for models.	generalized linear model	What analogy is used to explain generalized linear model (machine learning)?

A good analogy for generative adversarial networks is the game of chess. In chess, there are two opponents: White and Black. White tries to come up with a strategy to capture all of Black's pieces, while Black does everything possible to stop White from achieving this goal. The game of chess is a perfect example of a generative adversarial network because there are two competing agents trying to outsmart each other.	generative adversarial network (gan)	What analogy is used to explain generative adversarial network (gan) (machine learning)?
GAN is a machine learning technique that is used to generate new data. It works by having two neural networks compete against each other.

By constantly competing against each other, both networks improve their ability to produce realistic data.	generative adversarial network (gan)	What analogy is used to explain generative adversarial network (gan) (machine learning)?
In computer science, a generative adversarial network (GAN) is a type of artificial intelligence algorithm used in unsupervised learning that pits two neural networks against each other in a zero-sum game.

An analogy to explain gradient descent is that of a person walking downhill. The person takes small steps, gradually getting closer and closer to the bottom of the hill. This same concept applies when using gradient descent in machine learning; you gradually decrease the value of the error function until you reach a point where it’s minimal.	gradient	What analogy is used to explain gradient (machine learning)?
One analogy used to explain gradient descent is the story of a person walking down a hill. The goal is to reach the bottom of the hill, and so the person takes small steps in order to make gradual progress. In machine learning, gradient descent works in a similar way: it's used to find the optimal solution for a problem by taking small steps (or "adjustments") that move us closer towards our goal.	gradient	What analogy is used to explain gradient (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain gradient descent is the story of a person walking down a hill. The goal is to get to the bottom of the hill as quickly and easily as possible. To do this, the person takes small steps downhill, adjusting their direction as necessary. This is similar to how gradient descent works in machine learning – it iteratively moves closer towards the minimum error rate by taking small steps in the right direction (i.e., downwards).	gradient	What analogy is used to explain gradient (machine learning)?
The gradient is a measure of how much the error changes when moving from one point to another on a graph. It can be thought of as the slope of the line between two points on the graph.	gradient	What analogy is used to explain gradient (machine learning)?
Classical machine learning algorithms are “supervised” meaning that the computer is given a set of training data, and is then able to learn how to perform a task by generalizing from this data. The classic analogy for gradient descent is trying to find your way down a mountain while avoiding cliffs. You start at the top of the mountain (the current state or parameter vector), and you walk downhill (taking small steps) until you reach the bottom (a desired solution). Along the way, you keep track of your current location (the parameter vector), as well as the direction and magnitude of your descent (the gradient). If you ever stumble across a cliff, you can backtrack until you find safer ground.	gradient	What analogy is used to explain gradient (machine learning)?
An analogy for gradient clipping is cutting down a tree. The branches of the tree represent the gradient vector, and the trunk represents the magnitude of that gradient vector. When you are cutting down a tree, you can only cut so much off of each branch at a time or else you will damage the tree. You have to clip the branches one at a time in order to reduce them to a manageable size. In machine learning, you are reducing the size of the gradient vector by clipping its components one at a time.	gradient clipping	What analogy is used to explain gradient clipping (machine learning)?
Gradient clipping is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting of the model. It works by limiting the size of the gradient that can be passed back through the network, which helps to reduce the number of parameters that are being trained. The analogy that is often used to explain this concept is that of a staircase. Imagine you are trying to climb up a flight of stairs, but you only have two legs. By limiting how much you can move each step, you make it easier to climb the stairs. In the same way, gradient clipping makes it easier for a machine learning algorithm to learn complex patterns by limiting how large its gradients can be.	gradient clipping	What analogy is used to explain gradient clipping (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy for gradient clipping is like trimming the ends of a hedge. You clip off the growth that is too tall or out of control, so that the hedge is neat and tidy. In the same way, you can clip off parts of the gradient vector that are too large, so that your model does not overfit on the training data.	gradient clipping	What analogy is used to explain gradient clipping (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy for gradient clipping is that it is like a garden hose. The further the water is from the nozzle of the hose, the less pressure there is and consequently, the less water comes out. Gradient clipping can help to ensure that an algorithm doesn't "over shoot" or go too far in its attempts to optimize a given function by limiting how much its gradient can increase at any one point.	gradient clipping	What analogy is used to explain gradient clipping (machine learning)?
If you have a photo of a mountain, and you want to make the mountains look smaller in the photo, you can use gradient clipping. This is because when an image is clipped, it means that some parts of it will be cut off so that it looks more like what you want.	gradient clipping	What analogy is used to explain gradient clipping (machine learning)?
A greedy policy is a decision-making algorithm that always selects the action that appears to be best at any given point in time.	greedy policy	What analogy is used to explain greedy policy (machine learning)?
A greedy policy is a type of machine learning algorithm that works by taking the best option at each step. This can be helpful in some cases, but it can also lead to suboptimal decisions if used incorrectly.	greedy policy	What analogy is used to explain greedy policy (machine learning)?
A greedy policy in machine learning is analogous to a person trying to stuff as much food into their mouth as possible. The person will take small bites at first, but eventually they will start stuffing food in until they can't fit any more in.	greedy policy	What analogy is used to explain greedy policy (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain greedy policy is that of a machine learning algorithm. In this analogy, the greedy policy can be thought of as an overly aggressive learner which always chooses the best option it has currently found, regardless of whether or not there might be a better option available later on.	greedy policy	What analogy is used to explain greedy policy (machine learning)?
A greedy algorithm is one that takes the best possible action at every step, without considering future steps. This analogy compares a greedy policy to a vending machine. The vending machine only considers what it will gain from the next action (selling a candy bar), without thinking about how that decision might affect later choices (such as not having any more candy bars left to sell).	greedy policy	What analogy is used to explain greedy policy (machine learning)?
An analogy used to explain ground truth in machine learning is that it is the "true" or "correct" answer to a question. Ground truth is often used when training machines, as it allows them to better understand how they should be responding to certain questions or scenarios.	ground truth	What analogy is used to explain ground truth (machine learning)?
Ground truth is like a teacher. The teacher has the knowledge and can tell you what is right or wrong. In machine learning, ground truth is used to determine how well the machine learning algorithm is doing by checking against known correct answers.	ground truth	What analogy is used to explain ground truth (machine learning)?
A good analogy for ground truth would be to think of it as a dictionary. A dictionary is a compilation of all the words in a particular language, along with their definitions. It is the definitive source for understanding the meanings of words. In a similar way, ground truth provides an authoritative reference point for understanding how data should look and behave in order to be classified correctly by machine learning algorithms.	ground truth	What analogy is used to explain ground truth (machine learning)?
Ground truth is the comparison of actual results to what was predicted by a machine learning algorithm. This analogy compares it to a person being shown different pieces of paper with either a real diamond or a fake diamond hidden among them. The goal is for the person to identify which piece of paper has the real diamond. In order to do this, they would need to have access to both the diamonds and the papers. They would also need to be able to distinguish between the two types of diamonds. Once they had done this, they could then serve as ground truth by telling other people which pieces of paper have real diamonds and which don't.	ground truth	What analogy is used to explain ground truth (machine learning)?
A good analogy for "ground truth" in machine learning is the process of training a dog. The dog trainer provides positive reinforcement (praise, treats, petting) when the dog displays desired behavior, such as sitting or coming when called. Over time, the dog learns to associate these behaviors with the positive reinforcement and will display them more often. In a similar way, ground truth in machine learning refers to providing feedback (positive or negative) to help a machine learn how to accurately classify data.	ground truth	What analogy is used to explain ground truth (machine learning)?
When you learn to drive a car, at first it seems like every time your foot goes to the pedal something different happens. But with experience, you start to see patterns -ohananov- and develop expectations about how the car will respond in different situations. You learn to predict what will happen when you step on the gas, brake or turn the wheel based on past experience.With machine learning, computers are taught how to recognize patterns in data by adjusting their algorithms in response to feedback from humans (or other machines). Just as people can learn from their own experiences and those of others around them, so too can machines improve their performance through artificial intelligence (AI).	group attribution bias	What analogy is used to explain group attribution bias (machine learning)?
You are driving home from work, and you see a car on the side of the road with its hood up. You think to yourself, "I wonder if that car needs help." As you drive closer, you see that there is a woman inside the car waving her arms for help. You stop to offer assistance and realize that the woman has locked her keys in the car. The group attribution bias would say that you stopped to help because it was the right thing to do - not because you were influenced by the other people who were also stopped at the scene.	group attribution bias	What analogy is used to explain group attribution bias (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain group attribution bias is that of a group of people looking at a painting. Each person in the group will have their own interpretation of what they are seeing, but each person's interpretation will be based on their understanding of the whole painting, not just the part that they are looking at.	group attribution bias	What analogy is used to explain group attribution bias (machine learning)?
The analogy is that group attribution bias is similar to the way a computer hones in on specific features of an image when it is being taught to recognize objects. In the same way, humans tend to focus on specific aspects of a person or situation when trying to make a judgment about why something happened.	group attribution bias	What analogy is used to explain group attribution bias (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain group attribution bias is a school of fish. The fish are all swimming together in the same direction and it appears that they are all moving as one unit. In reality, each individual fish is swimming independently, but because they are all moving in the same direction, it looks like they are one entity.	group attribution bias	What analogy is used to explain group attribution bias (machine learning)?
Hashing is like finding a needle in a haystack.	hashing	What analogy is used to explain hashing (machine learning)?
Hashing is often described as a function that takes in an input string and produces a 32-bit integer. The function is designed in such a way that it’s very unlikely for two different strings to produce the same hash value.	hashing	What analogy is used to explain hashing (machine learning)?
Hashing is often compared to a shredder. Just as you can put multiple pieces of paper into a shredder and they will be reduced to small pieces, hashing takes input data and reduces it to a smaller size. This makes it more difficult for someone who unauthorized access the data to piece it back together again.	hashing	What analogy is used to explain hashing (machine learning)?
Hashing is machine learning is often compared to sorting your laundry. You take all of the clothes in your dirty pile and put them into one big tub. Then, you grab a single shirt from the top of the pile and wash it. Once it’s clean, you put it back on top of the pile. This process repeats until all of the clothes are clean. Hashing works in a very similar way. You take all of the data that you want to hash and put it into one big tub (or bucket). Then, you grab a single piece of data and hash it. Once it’s hashed, you put it back into the bucket. This process repeats until all of the data is hashed	hashing	What analogy is used to explain hashing (machine learning)?
Hashing is used for machine learning as a way to compress data. Just like when you zip a file, the hashing algorithm takes a collection of data and creates a smaller, unique code that represents the information. That code can then be used to easily reference and identify the data set later.	hashing	What analogy is used to explain hashing (machine learning)?
An analogy used to explain heuristic (machine learning) is that it is like a child learning how to speak. The child starts with a few words and then builds on their knowledge by adding new words, and using the words they know in different combinations.	heuristic	What analogy is used to explain heuristic (machine learning)?
Heuristic is machine learning analogy is that it is like a child learning how to speak. A baby does not learn by being given a list of rules for speaking, but rather by hearing people talk and trying to imitate what they hear. In the same way, a heuristic algorithm learns how to solve problems by observing examples and trying to match the best solution it finds in its database of examples.	heuristic	What analogy is used to explain heuristic (machine learning)?
One analogy is that of a person learning to drive a car. At first, the person has to think about all the individual actions required - turning the wheel, depressing the accelerator, etc. After doing it for a while, however, driving becomes second nature and most of those actions are no longer consciously thought about. Instead, the person can focus on more strategic tasks (like where they're going). In much the same way, machines can learn how to do certain things by following specific instructions or algorithms (known as 'training data'). Over time and with enough practice ('learning') they can start to figure out some things for themselves by applying general principles ('heuristics').	heuristic	What analogy is used to explain heuristic (machine learning)?
A heuristic can be thought of as a "rule of thumb." A machine learning algorithm might use a heuristic to determine how likely it is that a new input belongs to one of the classes it has been trained to recognize.	heuristic	What analogy is used to explain heuristic (machine learning)?
The analogy of a human being is used to explain heuristic machine learning. Just as humans learn through experience, machines can also be programmed to learn and make decisions through experience.	heuristic	What analogy is used to explain heuristic (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a black box. The input is fed in, and the hidden layer churns away, spitting out an output. We don’t really know what’s going on inside the black box, but it seems to work!	hidden layer	What analogy is used to explain hidden layer (machine learning)?
The hidden layer is often compared to the human brain. The input layer corresponds to the senses, such as sight and sound. The output layer corresponds to actions, such as talking and walking. The hidden layer in between is responsible for processing information and making decisions.	hidden layer	What analogy is used to explain hidden layer (machine learning)?
A good analogy for a hidden layer is a group of people who are working together to hide something. The people in the group are like the neurons in the hidden layer, and they pass information along to one another until it's hidden from view. Just like with a human group, there can be many layers of hidden data in a machine learning algorithm.	hidden layer	What analogy is used to explain hidden layer (machine learning)?
The hidden layer in machine learning is analogous to the human brain. Just as our brains can learn and recognize patterns, so too can machines thanks to their hidden layers.	hidden layer	What analogy is used to explain hidden layer (machine learning)?
This analogy is used to explain the concept of a hidden layer in machine learning. The first layer in a neural network is like an image sensor that takes pictures of objects. The second layer consists of neurons that are trained to recognize patterns in the images from the first layer. These recognition algorithms become more accurate as more data is fed into the system, allowing it to learn how to identify specific objects or features.	hidden layer	What analogy is used to explain hidden layer (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy for hierarchical clustering is the process of group members into families based on similarities, then further subdividing those groups into smaller subgroups until all members are accounted for.	hierarchical clustering	What analogy is used to explain hierarchical clustering (machine learning)?
One analogy for hierarchical clustering is that it is like putting people into social groups. At the top of the hierarchy are the people who are in the most social groups. Then, as you go down the hierarchy, there are fewer and fewer people in each group. The last group has only one person in it.	hierarchical clustering	What analogy is used to explain hierarchical clustering (machine learning)?
Hierarchical clustering can be thought of as a tree-like structure. The leaves of the tree are the individual data points, and the branches of the tree represent clusters. The root of the tree is at level 0, and each branch represents a new level in the hierarchy. At each level, all of the data points within that cluster are merged into a single point.	hierarchical clustering	What analogy is used to explain hierarchical clustering (machine learning)?
One analogy for hierarchical clustering is that it is like putting a jigsaw puzzle together. The pieces of the puzzle are similar (they all fit together), and they are organized in order from largest to smallest.	hierarchical clustering	What analogy is used to explain hierarchical clustering (machine learning)?
Hierarchical clustering is like a tree. The leaves are the individual data points, and the branches are the clusters.	hierarchical clustering	What analogy is used to explain hierarchical clustering (machine learning)?

A hinge loss is a machine learning term used to describe the penalty incurred when a neural network incorrectly classifies an input.	hinge loss	What analogy is used to explain hinge loss (machine learning)?
The analogy of hinge loss is that it is like a door. If you close the door, and then open it again, it will be off its hinges. This is because when you close the door, all of the pressure is on the hinges, which can cause them to break. In machine learning, hinge loss happens when a neural network gets stuck in a local minimum and can't find a way to improve its performance any further.	hinge loss	What analogy is used to explain hinge loss (machine learning)?
Hinge loss is often compared to a poker game. In both cases, you are trying to make the best decision possible given the information you have. In poker, your goal is to make the most money possible over many hands. With machine learning, your goal is to make the most accurate predictions possible with each new data point.	hinge loss	What analogy is used to explain hinge loss (machine learning)?
Hinge loss is a machine learning term that refers to the amount of error in a prediction made by a model. In other words, hinge loss is the difference between the predicted value and the actual value. This loss is often used when training models in order to improve accuracy.	hinge loss	What analogy is used to explain hinge loss (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain holdout data is that it is the "testing set" or "validation set" in machine learning. It is used to test how accurate a model is at predicting future events.	holdout data	What analogy is used to explain holdout data (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain holdout data is that it is like a train station. The first group of people who get on the train are the passengers and the next group of people who try to get on the train are the holdouts. The analogy explains that just because a passenger has gotten on the train, it doesn't mean that there isn't still room for more passengers. In machine learning, this analogy is used to explain how models can be improved by using more data.	holdout data	What analogy is used to explain holdout data (machine learning)?
A holdout is a data set that is used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning algorithm. The holdout set is not used in the training of the machine learning algorithm, and it is typically randomly selected from the data set.	holdout data	What analogy is used to explain holdout data (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy for holdout data is that it is like a "private" or "test set" of data. The idea is that you can use this data to evaluate the performance of your machine learning algorithm on unseen data (i.e., the "holdout set"), without worrying about overfitting to the training data.	holdout data	What analogy is used to explain holdout data (machine learning)?
The example of holdout data is used to explain that in machine learning, the training and test sets are divided into two parts. The first part (the training set) is used to train the model. The second part (the test set) is used to evaluate how well the model has been trained.	holdout data	What analogy is used to explain holdout data (machine learning)?
In machine learning, hyperparameters are analogous to the knobs and switches on a stereo receiver. Just as you can adjust the bass, treble, and other settings on your stereo to get the sound just the way you like it, you can also adjust the hyperparameters of a machine learning algorithm to optimize its performance for your particular dataset.	hyperparameter	What analogy is used to explain hyperparameter (machine learning)?
A hyperparameter is a parameter of a machine learning algorithm that is not learned during the training process, but rather set by the user. It can be thought of as analogous to the knobs and levers on a machine that are used to adjust its operation.	hyperparameter	What analogy is used to explain hyperparameter (machine learning)?
In hyperparameter optimization, you are like a mountain climber on a difficult ascent. You have reached a point where you can see the summit, but it is still far away. You know that if you want to reach the summit, you need to make some hard decisions about which route to take and which tools to use. In the same way, in machine learning we need to decide on the best model parameters (the route) and the best model structure (the tools).	hyperparameter	What analogy is used to explain hyperparameter (machine learning)?
A hyperparameter is like the knob on a stereo that controls how loud the music gets. It's a parameter of the system that you can tweak to change the way it behaves.	hyperparameter	What analogy is used to explain hyperparameter (machine learning)?
Tuning a guitar	hyperparameter	What analogy is used to explain hyperparameter (machine learning)?
A hyperplane is a mathematical concept that explains how machines learn. It is essentially a flat plane that slices through all of the data in a particular way. The hyperplane can be thought of as a series of decision boundaries that help to classify or sort data.	hyperplane	What analogy is used to explain hyperplane (machine learning)?
A hyperplane is a flat surface in mathematics that is used to divide a space into two or more regions. In machine learning, it can be thought of as the boundary between different classes of data.	hyperplane	What analogy is used to explain hyperplane (machine learning)?
A hyperplane is a mathematical concept used in machine learning. It is an infinite set of parallel lines that divide a space into two parts.	hyperplane	What analogy is used to explain hyperplane (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy for a hyperplane is to think of it as a fence. The fence divides two areas, one on each side of the fence. The area on the left side of the fence is for cows and the area on the right side of the fence is for horses. If you want to put a cow in with the horses, you can lift up or move the fence to make room for the cow.	hyperplane	What analogy is used to explain hyperplane (machine learning)?
A hyperplane is like a fence that separates two areas of land. The fence has a point at which it crosses the middle of the area, and this is called the hyperplane's origin.	hyperplane	What analogy is used to explain hyperplane (machine learning)?
An analogy to help explain i.i.d is the use of coins in a slot machine. If you pull the lever on a slot machine enough times, you would expect each coin that comes out to be randomly distributed – just like flipping a fair coin. This is what we mean when we say that our data is “independently and identically distributed” (i.i.d).	i.i.d.	What analogy is used to explain i.i.d. (machine learning)?
I.i.d is used to explain machine learning as being like a coin flip. Just as every time you flip a coin, the probability of getting heads or tails is 50%, the chances of an event occurring again are always the same, regardless of what has happened in the past. This is also known as 'conditional independence'.	i.i.d.	What analogy is used to explain i.i.d. (machine learning)?
One analogy used to explain i.i.d is that it is like rolling a die repeatedly. The probability of any given outcome (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6) remains the same each time the die is rolled, so the likelihood of getting any particular number is 1/6th.	i.i.d.	What analogy is used to explain i.i.d. (machine learning)?
A good analogy for i.i.d is to think of it as a bag of marbles. Each marble inside the bag is drawn from a population of identical marbles, so each marble is exactly like every other one in the population. The properties of any given marble are completely determined by the properties of the population from which it was sampled.	i.i.d.	What analogy is used to explain i.i.d. (machine learning)?
Analogy: The assumption of i.i.d. can be thought of as the machine learning equivalent to assuming that the training data is drawn from a Normal distribution.	i.i.d.	What analogy is used to explain i.i.d. (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain image recognition is that it is similar to how humans learn. When a human baby sees a dog for the first time, they do not know what a dog is. But, through experience and being around dogs, the baby will start to learn what a dog looks like and recognize them when they see them again. The same process happens with machine learning algorithms. They are trained on data (in this case images) and learn how to recognize patterns.	image recognition	What analogy is used to explain image recognition (machine learning)?
Analogy: Image recognition can be thought of as a computer being able to look at a picture of, for example, a cat and then “learn” what a cat looks like. After looking at enough pictures of cats, the computer will have learned what features are common to most cats (e.g., four legs, fur, whiskers, etc.) and will be able to identify cats in new pictures with high accuracy.	image recognition	What analogy is used to explain image recognition (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain image recognition is that it is like a human being recognizing somebody they know.	image recognition	What analogy is used to explain image recognition (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain image recognition is that it is like a person recognizing a friend's face. The machine learning algorithm has been "trained" on many photos of faces, and so when it sees a new photo, it compares the features of that photo with the features of all the other photos that it has seen before. If there is a high degree of similarity between the new photo and one of the old photos, then the machine will recognize the face in the new photo.	image recognition	What analogy is used to explain image recognition (machine learning)?
The analogy of image recognition is that it is similar to a human looking at a picture. The human can see the different objects in the picture and knows what they are. A machine learning algorithm is trained on a large set of images. It then “sees” an image and recognizes all of the different objects in it.	image recognition	What analogy is used to explain image recognition (machine learning)?
A dataset can be balanced by randomly selecting items from each category so that the number of instances in each category are approximately equal. This is analogous to how a human might balance a scale by placing an equal number of weights on either side.	imbalanced dataset	What analogy is used to explain imbalanced dataset (machine learning)?
The analogy is used to explain that in a machine learning algorithm, the dataset is often imbalanced. In other words, there are many more examples of one type of data point (label) than another. This can cause problems for algorithms because they may be more likely to learn the patterns present in the majority class rather than the minority class.	imbalanced dataset	What analogy is used to explain imbalanced dataset (machine learning)?
A dataset can be thought of as being balanced if the number of observations in each class are approximately equal. A dataset can be thought of as being imbalanced if there is a large discrepancy between the number of observations in different classes. In machine learning, an imbalanced dataset is often said to be "unfair" because algorithms that rely on counting examples (like support vector machines or naive Bayes) will perform very poorly on them.	imbalanced dataset	What analogy is used to explain imbalanced dataset (machine learning)?
A medical doctor may use the analogy of disease to explain an imbalanced dataset. If a patient has cancer, for example, that patient is much more likely to have other health problems than a patient who does not have cancer. In the same way, in an imbalanced dataset, certain classes (e.g., sick patients) are much more likely to occur than others (e.g., healthy patients).	imbalanced dataset	What analogy is used to explain imbalanced dataset (machine learning)?
A balanced dataset is like a scale where each side has the same number of items. An unbalanced dataset is like a see-saw, where one end has many more items than the other.	imbalanced dataset	What analogy is used to explain imbalanced dataset (machine learning)?
An analogy used to explain implicit bias is that it is like a machine learning algorithm. Just as the algorithm can be trained on lots of data so that it becomes better at predicting outcomes, people’s biases are shaped by their experiences and the messages they receive from the world around them.	implicit bias	What analogy is used to explain implicit bias (machine learning)?
The implicit bias of a machine learning algorithm is often compared to the implicit biases of humans. Just as humans can learn about their own inherent biases and try to correct them, machine learning algorithms can be “trained” to identify and compensate for any unintentional biases in their data.	implicit bias	What analogy is used to explain implicit bias (machine learning)?
The analogy of implicit bias is being used as a machine learning technique. Just like humans have an automatic association that they may not even be aware of, computers can be trained to do the same by recognizing patterns in data.	implicit bias	What analogy is used to explain implicit bias (machine learning)?
An analogy to implicit bias in machine learning is the way a computer can be taught to recognize objects. For example, if you show a computer image of a cat and then another image of a dog, the computer will learn to "recognize" that both images are animals. However, if you only show the computer pictures of cats, it will not be able to correctly identify dogs in an image. This is because the computer has been implicitly biased towards recognizing cats based on the data that was shown to it.	implicit bias	What analogy is used to explain implicit bias (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is like a person that has been trained to associate images of cars with the word "car." If you show the machine an image of a car, it will be more likely to guess that the image contains the word "car."	implicit bias	What analogy is used to explain implicit bias (machine learning)?
This analogy is used to explain incompatibility of fairness metrics (machine learning): It is like trying to pour two different liquids into the same container. The liquids might be able to mix for a little while, but eventually they will separate and each will take its own form. In the same way, if you try to use two different fairness metrics on the same data set, they will eventually separate and each metric will give its own results.	incompatibility of fairness metrics	What analogy is used to explain incompatibility of fairness metrics (machine learning)?
It is as if you are in a classroom and the teacher grades on a curve, but you don’t know what the curve is. You would never know how hard you need to study or whether you got an A or not.	incompatibility of fairness metrics	What analogy is used to explain incompatibility of fairness metrics (machine learning)?
Asking a machine learning algorithm to be fair is like asking a person to grade their own tests.	incompatibility of fairness metrics	What analogy is used to explain incompatibility of fairness metrics (machine learning)?
It is like trying to put a square peg in a round hole.	incompatibility of fairness metrics	What analogy is used to explain incompatibility of fairness metrics (machine learning)?
Incompatible fairness metrics for machine learning can be compared to different languages. If two people are trying to communicate but one person only knows English and the other person only knows Spanish, they will not be able to effectively communicate. The same is true for machines - if they are using different fairness metrics, they will not be able to understand each other.	incompatibility of fairness metrics	What analogy is used to explain incompatibility of fairness metrics (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy to describe independently and identically distributed (i.i.d) data is as follows: imagine you have a room full of 100 people, all of whom are identical in every way - age, sex, height, weight, etc. Now imagine that you randomly select one person from the group and measure their height. The likelihood that any given person in the group has a particular height is exactly the same - 1/100th chance for each person. This is what it means for data to be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d).	independently and identically distributed (i.i.d)	What analogy is used to explain independently and identically distributed (i.i.d) (machine learning)?
A data set is said to be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d), if every observation in the data set was drawn from a population with the same distribution.	independently and identically distributed (i.i.d)	What analogy is used to explain independently and identically distributed (i.i.d) (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a black box which takes in input data (X) and produces an output (Y). The assumption is that the distribution of Y is independent of X, i.e. the output Y is randomly generated for each instance x, irrespective of all other instances. This assumption is called "independence" or "i.i.d."	independently and identically distributed (i.i.d)	What analogy is used to explain independently and identically distributed (i.i.d) (machine learning)?
When flipping coins, each flip is independent of the other flips, and the outcomes are identically distributed.	independently and identically distributed (i.i.d)	What analogy is used to explain independently and identically distributed (i.i.d) (machine learning)?
A bag of marbles is a possible analogy. If you were to shake up the bag, each marble would have an equal chance of coming out at any time. This would be analogous to i.i.d data in which each example is independent of the others and has the same distribution.	independently and identically distributed (i.i.d)	What analogy is used to explain independently and identically distributed (i.i.d) (machine learning)?
The analogy to explain individual fairness in machine learning is that each student is graded on their own merits, and not compared to anyone else.	individual fairness	What analogy is used to explain individual fairness (machine learning)?
If you think of a machine learning algorithm as a black box, it is often difficult to understand why the algorithm produces the results that it does. However, if you can see inside the black box, you can tweak its settings until it behaves in a way that is more fair to individual data points.	individual fairness	What analogy is used to explain individual fairness (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain individual fairness in machine learning is a classroom with students of different abilities. In order for the class to be fair, each student must be given an opportunity to learn and be challenged at their own level. This can be accomplished using differentiated instruction methods that cater to each student's unique needs. Similarly, in machine learning, it is important for each individual learner (a data point) to have its own personalized experience so that it can improve over time.	individual fairness	What analogy is used to explain individual fairness (machine learning)?
A computer scientist might say that individual fairness is like a machine learning algorithm that is “tuned” to avoid bias. Just as we can adjust the settings on a machine learning algorithm to make it more or less likely to produce biased results, we can do the same thing with our ideas about fairness. We can try to create systems that are fair by design, or we can adjust how we use those systems in order to reduce the chances of unfairness happening.	individual fairness	What analogy is used to explain individual fairness (machine learning)?
The machine learning analogy used to explain individual fairness is similar to that of a vending machine. When you put in your money, the machine gives you one item in return, no matter what that item may be. In the context of individual fairness, this means that each person who submits data to a machine learning algorithm will get an answer in return, and no two people will receive the same answer.	individual fairness	What analogy is used to explain individual fairness (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain inference (machine learning) is that it is similar to teaching a computer how to recognize objects. You first show the computer pictures of objects, and then teach the computer what each object looks like by telling it what features to look for. After doing this enough times, the computer will be able to identify objects in pictures without being specifically told what to look for.	inference	What analogy is used to explain inference (machine learning)?
The inference (machine learning) analogy is used to explain how a computer can learn. Inference is the ability of a machine to understand and learn from data, without being explicitly programmed.	inference	What analogy is used to explain inference (machine learning)?
Inference is like a human brain. It takes in data (input) and processes it to form conclusions (output).	inference	What analogy is used to explain inference (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain inference (machine learning) is that of a detective. A detective collects evidence at the scene of a crime and then uses this evidence to infer who committed the crime. Similarly, a machine learning algorithm collects data (the evidence) and then uses this data to infer patterns or relationships (who committed the crime).	inference	What analogy is used to explain inference (machine learning)?
Inference (machine learning) is like a human’s brain. It takes in data as input, and then processes it to come to conclusions.	inference	What analogy is used to explain inference (machine learning)?
The analogy is that in-group bias is like a machine learning algorithm that has been “trained” on a particular set of data. The more data the algorithm has to work with, the better it will be at discriminating between different types of objects (in this case, people). However, if the algorithm only ever sees data from one group of people (the in-group), it will become biased against out-groups (people who are not part of the in-group).	in-group bias	What analogy is used to explain in-group bias (machine learning)?
Grouping people into an "in-group" and "out-group" is a common way to think about in-group bias. In the context of machine learning, you can think of the in-group as being all of the data that the machine learning algorithm has been trained on, and the out-group as being all of the data that isn't included in the training set. The algorithm will be more likely to make predictions that match what it has seen before (i.e., within the in-group), relative to making predictions that don't match anything it has seen before (i.e., outside of the in-group).	in-group bias	What analogy is used to explain in-group bias (machine learning)?
Grouping people into a category is like having a machine learning algorithm. The first time the algorithm sees someone, it doesn't know how to group them. But as it sees more and more examples of people, it gradually starts to learn which group each person belongs in.	in-group bias	What analogy is used to explain in-group bias (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain in-group bias is that it is like a person’s Facebook friends. A person is more likely to trust the opinions of their Facebook friends than people they do not know. In the same way, a machine learning algorithm is more likely to trust the opinions of other algorithms it knows (in its “in-group”) than algorithms it does not know.	in-group bias	What analogy is used to explain in-group bias (machine learning)?
An analogy used to explain in-group bias is that of a school of fish. The group moves together as one entity and behaves differently when they are separated from the group.	in-group bias	What analogy is used to explain in-group bias (machine learning)?
The input layer is the first layer in a machine learning algorithm. This layer takes in data, which may be in the form of numbers, text, or images. The input layer then passes this data on to subsequent layers in the algorithm.	input layer	What analogy is used to explain input layer (machine learning)?
The input layer can be likened to the human senses. The information that is input into the system (the data) is what is initially processed by the machine learning algorithm.	input layer	What analogy is used to explain input layer (machine learning)?
The input layer is like the front of your computer where you plug in all of your devices. The input layer accepts information from the outside world and passes it along to subsequent layers for processing.	input layer	What analogy is used to explain input layer (machine learning)?
The input layer is like the entrance to a library. The books in the library are arranged according to their subject matter, and new books are added to the shelves all the time.	input layer	What analogy is used to explain input layer (machine learning)?
The input layer is like the foundation of a house. It's what everything else is built on top of.	input layer	What analogy is used to explain input layer (machine learning)?
Interpretability is a bit like taking an X-ray of your body. With enough detail, you can understand where all the bones are and what they’re doing. However, you can also get a high-level understanding just by looking at the overall shape of the person in the image. In machine learning, interpretability gives us a way to “see under the hood” of our models and understand how they make their predictions.	interpretability	What analogy is used to explain interpretability (machine learning)?
A. Interpretability is like a map. It can help you understand where you are and how to get to your destination.B. Interpretability is like a key. It can help you unlock the mysteries of what the machine learning model is doing.C. Interpretability is like a microscope. It can help you see what’s going on inside the black box of the machine learning model	interpretability	What analogy is used to explain interpretability (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain interpretability (machine learning) is that it is like a can of paint. The first layer of the can is the outside surface and the last layer is the inside surface. For machine learning, you are able to see what the first layers are doing (outside surface), but not what is happening in the inner layers (inside surface).	interpretability	What analogy is used to explain interpretability (machine learning)?
An analogy that is often used to explain interpretability in machine learning is the idea of a black box. A black box is a device or system that can input data and produce an output, but the inner workings of the device are unknown. In machine learning, a model can be seen as a black box because we may not understand why it produces certain predictions. However, we can still use the model to make predictions by feeding it data and seeing what comes out. Interpretability allows us to peek inside the black box and understand how it works. This understanding can help us trust the predictions made by the model and also troubleshoot any problems that may arise.	interpretability	What analogy is used to explain interpretability (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain interpretability is that of a human being. Just as we can understand why someone did something by looking at their facial expressions, body language, and words, a machine learning model can be made to interpretable by inspecting the features it has learned and the decisions it makes.	interpretability	What analogy is used to explain interpretability (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain inter-rater agreement (machine learning) is that of a teacher and their students. The students are the data set, and the teacher is the algorithm. The more times the teacher reviews the students' work, the more accurate their grading will be. This is because they are able to learn from their mistakes and better differentiate between different student's answers.	inter-rater agreement	What analogy is used to explain inter-rater agreement (machine learning)?
Inter-rater agreement is often explained using the example of a person learning to identify objects. In the beginning, the person may only be able to reliably identify a few objects. As they learn more, their ability to correctly identify objects improves and they are able to classify more things into categories. This increased accuracy is analogous to improved inter-rater agreement as training data accumulates.	inter-rater agreement	What analogy is used to explain inter-rater agreement (machine learning)?
A good analogy for understanding inter-rater agreement is to think of humans as judges in a beauty pageant. In order to select the most beautiful contestant, each judge rates all of the contestants on a scale from 1 to 10. After all of the ratings are collected, the contestants with the highest average score (i.e., the highest number of “10” ratings) are declared the winners.Now imagine that instead of having human judges, we had a machine learning algorithm judging Beauty Pageant contestants. In this scenario, there would be no disagreement among judges because the machine would simply output the same list of winners as determined by its mathematical calculations.	inter-rater agreement	What analogy is used to explain inter-rater agreement (machine learning)?
A good analogy for understanding inter-rater agreement is to think of humans as independent sensors, or cameras, taking photos of the same object from different angles. If two people take a photo of the same object from slightly different angles, their photos are likely to be very similar. However, if one person takes a photo of the object from one angle and another person takes a photo of the object from a different angle, their photos are likely to be quite different. This is because each person’s perspective is unique. In order to get an accurate representation of the object, you need pictures taken from multiple perspectives.The same idea applies when training machine learning models. To ensure that your model accurately predicts outcomes, it’s important to have data inputted by multiple people (or machines). This helps reduce bias and ensures that your model is robust enough to predict outcomes even in challenging situations.	inter-rater agreement	What analogy is used to explain inter-rater agreement (machine learning)?
Algorithm testing can be thought of as a form of quality control. Just as different machines produce slightly different products, so too do different algorithms produce somewhat different results. By checking the output of each algorithm against some reference standard, it is possible to determine how well they reproduce that standard. This process is called “algorithmic calibration” or “algorithmic validation”.	inter-rater agreement	What analogy is used to explain inter-rater agreement (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain intersection over union is that it is like taking a Venn diagram and overlapping the circles. The area where the circles overlap is what is being calculated.	intersection over union (iou)	What analogy is used to explain intersection over union (iou) (machine learning)?
Intersection over union (IOU) is a measure used in machine learning to determine how likely it is that two models are representing the same underlying distribution. The IOU of two models A and B, written as I(A,B), is computed as the intersection divided by theunion of the predicted distributions for A and B:I(A,B) = ∩P(x|A)·P(x|B) / ∪P(x|A)·P(x|B)	intersection over union (iou)	What analogy is used to explain intersection over union (iou) (machine learning)?
Union is like a Venn diagram with two circles, one for cats and one for dogs. Intersection is the part of the circle that overlaps, where both cats and dogs are present.	intersection over union (iou)	What analogy is used to explain intersection over union (iou) (machine learning)?
Intersection over Union (IOU) is a measure of how well different models predict the overlap between their datasets, rather than the total number of data points each model predicts. IOU can be thought of as analogous to voting: if two models both predict that a particular person will vote, but only one also predicts they will vote for candidate A while the other only predicts they will vote for candidate B, then we would say that the first model has an IOU of 1 with respect to candidate A and 0 with respect to candidate B.	intersection over union (iou)	What analogy is used to explain intersection over union (iou) (machine learning)?
Intersection over union (IOU) is a machine learning term used to describe the performance of a classifier on two types of data: positive examples that belong to the target class and negative examples that do not. The intersection of these sets is the data set on which the classifier will be most accurate, while the union is less discriminating.	intersection over union (iou)	What analogy is used to explain intersection over union (iou) (machine learning)?
The analogy for machine learning is a computer is like a baby. A computer starts with no knowledge and gradually learns what it needs to know to be effective.	iou	What analogy is used to explain iou (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain machine learning is that it is similar to the human brain. The machine learning algorithm is constantly exposed to data and examples, just like a baby’s brain. As the machine learning algorithm continues to be exposed to more data, its ability to learn and make predictions will improve.	iou	What analogy is used to explain iou (machine learning)?
A common analogy for machine learning is the process of how a human learns. When a baby is born, it does not come into the world knowing how to speak or understand any language. Over time, however, it begins to learn from the people around it, picking up words and rules for grammar until it can eventually converse in that language. Machine learning works in a similar way. Computers start off with no knowledge of what they are trying to learn. But through trial and error (i.e., being "trained" on data), they gradually figure out what is going on and become better at predicting outcomes or identifying patterns.	iou	What analogy is used to explain iou (machine learning)?
One analogy to explain machine learning is that it is like a child learning how to speak. A baby does not learn language instantly, but rather through trial and error — listening to others speaking, practicing saying words and sentences themselves, and getting feedback on their pronunciation. In the same way, a machine learning algorithm “learns” by ingesting data, trying different algorithms or techniques to see which works best on that data set, and improving its performance over time.	iou	What analogy is used to explain iou (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy compares it to the way a baby learns how to speak. Babies listen to people around them speaking, and over time they begin to understand and mimic the sounds that they hear. Similarly, a machine learning algorithm observes data examples and tries to learn patterns in order to make predictions or decisions.	iou	What analogy is used to explain iou (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain item matrix is that it is like a map. The map helps you find your way around and figure out where things are. The item matrix does the same thing for machine learning, it helps you find your way around and figure out what different items are.	item matrix	What analogy is used to explain item matrix (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain item matrix is that it is like a library. The library has books on different subjects and each book can be borrowed by multiple people. The item matrix is similar in that it stores information about different items, and each item can be associated with multiple features.	item matrix	What analogy is used to explain item matrix (machine learning)?
Item matrix is similar to a spreadsheet. It has data in columns and rows, which can be manipulated to see different relationships between the data.	item matrix	What analogy is used to explain item matrix (machine learning)?

In learning, l1 regularization (a.k.a. sparsity-promoting regularization) is a technique employed to avoid overfitting the model to the training data.[It] achieves this by penalizing the weights of neurons in the network according to their “sparsity” – that is, how few connections are assigned to them.(wikipedia)L1 regularization can be thought of as akin to placing a band around an elastic material; it resists stretching in one direction more than another. In machine learning, L1regularization biases the neural network towards models with fewer parameters (i.e., those that look more like linear models), which helps prevent overfitting on training data.	l1 regularization	What analogy is used to explain l1 regularization (machine learning)?
The analogy of adding salt to water is often used to explain regularization. Just as adding salt makes the water more viscous, so too does regularization make the learning algorithm more resistant to overfitting on the training data.	l1 regularization	What analogy is used to explain l1 regularization (machine learning)?
A common analogy for L1 regularization is that it is like putting a stiff collar around the neck of a dog. This limits how much the dog can move its head in any direction, which makes it easier to control. In the same way, L1 regularization “stiffens” or constrains the model parameters, making them easier to optimize and reducing the risk of overfitting.	l1 regularization	What analogy is used to explain l1 regularization (machine learning)?
If you have ever taken a foreign language class, then you are probably familiar with the idea of “vowel reduction.” Basically, this is when certain vowel sounds in a word are pronounced more subtly than they would be in their full form. For example, the Spanish word for “cat” is el gato. However, if you were to say the word very slowly and clearly enunciate each letter, it would sound like ee-yaa-toh. In other words, the first vowel (the one that appears as an i in English) is reduced to a schwa (represented by the ə symbol). This happens because Spanish has fewer vowels than English does, so speakers have to make do with what they have.L1 regularization can be thought of in much the same way. In machine learning terminology, L1 regularization (or just L1) refers to a technique used to reduce overfitting on training data sets by penalizing models that produce too many intricate details or parameters. The penalty parameter (λ) associated with L1 is typically positive and controls how much weight is given to model complexity relative to other considerations such as prediction accuracy.[2] In other words, increasing λ will cause models fitted using L1regularization to increasingly favor simpler solutions at the expense of generalizability.	l1 regularization	What analogy is used to explain l1 regularization (machine learning)?
Analogy: think of l1 regularization as a way to "shrink" the size of your model. It does this by penalizing models that have more parameters than are necessary. This helps prevent overfitting, since adding extra parameters can make your model more susceptible to fitting the training data perfectly and not generalizing well to new data.	l1 regularization	What analogy is used to explain l1 regularization (machine learning)?
The signal loss in a telephone line is an analogy for the l2 loss (machine learning) that can occur when training a machine learning algorithm.

In both cases, this can result in degraded performance or incorrect information being transmitted.	l2 loss	What analogy is used to explain l2 loss (machine learning)?
Analogy: L2 loss is like a person who has lost their glasses. They can still see, but it's not as clear or easy as when they have their glasses on.	l2 loss	What analogy is used to explain l2 loss (machine learning)?
L2 loss is often explained using the analogy of a teacher grading students’ homework. The teacher wants to give each student the best grade possible, but also wants to make sure that all students have learned the material. To achieve this, the teacher uses a grading rubric with different criteria (e.g., correctness, completeness, etc.) and assigns grades based on how well each student performs against these criteria. In machine learning, L2 loss is used to measure how well a machine learning algorithm “learns” or predicts target variables given a set of training data. Just as the teacher wants to ensure all students learn the material, L2 loss tries to minimize differences between the predictions of the machine learning algorithm and actual values in the training dataset.	l2 loss	What analogy is used to explain l2 loss (machine learning)?
The most common analogy to explain L2 loss is that it’s similar to a person trying to learn a new language. In the beginning, they will make many mistakes and not be very accurate in their use of the new language. However, with practice, they will become more proficient and eventually reach a level where they make very few mistakes.	l2 loss	What analogy is used to explain l2 loss (machine learning)?
The most common analogy for explaining L2 loss is that it’s similar to a teacher grading students on their homework assignments. The teacher wants each student to do their best, but the goal is not just to make sure all the students get an A. Some students may need more help than others and so the teacher may give them a lower grade if they don’t do as well as other students. In the same way, L2 loss helps ensure that the neural network is learning effectively, but it also takes into account how much help different parts of the network need in order to improve.	l2 loss	What analogy is used to explain l2 loss (machine learning)?
L2 regularization can be thought of as a way to reduce the variance in a model's predictions. This is done by adding an extra term to the cost function that penalizes models for making inaccurate predictions.

The analogy is that l2 regularization is like a weight attached to the learning algorithm, which makes it pull harder in the direction of the correct answer. This extra weight helps to prevent overfitting and boosts the accuracy of the predictions made by the machine learning algorithm.	l2 regularization	What analogy is used to explain l2 regularization (machine learning)?
L2 regularization is a machine learning technique used to avoid overfitting. It can be thought of as a kind of “spacing out” of the data points in order to create more space between clusters of data. This makes the clusters less dense and easier to differentiate from one another, which helps the algorithm learn better generalizable patterns.	l2 regularization	What analogy is used to explain l2 regularization (machine learning)?
Analogy: Machine learning is like teaching a child to read. You start by showing them some letters and how they are put together to spell words.

It then uses those patterns to make predictions about future events.	labeled example	What analogy is used to explain labeled example (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a function, where the input is a collection of training data, and the output is a prediction for some target variable.

The analogy is that logistic regression (machine learning) is like a microscope. It can be used to zoom in on small details in data and make predictions about how likely it is that something will happen.	logistic regression	What analogy is used to explain logistic regression (machine learning)?
A logistic regression is like a mathematician trying to predict whether a student will pass or fail a class. The mathematician looks at the student’s past grades and tries to find patterns that can help him predict the future grade.	logistic regression	What analogy is used to explain logistic regression (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain logistic regression is using a voting system. In this analogy, there are two candidates and the voter has to choose one of them. The vote can be either for or against a candidate. If the number of people who voted for the candidate is greater than the number of people who voted against the candidate, then that candidate wins (this is like a “Yes” in logistic regression). Otherwise, the other candidate wins (this is like a “No” in logistic regression).	logistic regression	What analogy is used to explain logistic regression (machine learning)?
Logits can be thought of as the probability that a particular observation (output) is generated given a set of input data.	logits	What analogy is used to explain logits (machine learning)?
Logits are used to explain machine learning because they allow for a much more accurate prediction of the probability that something will happen. This is done by converting all of the factors into a number between 0 and 1, which makes it easier to see how likely something is to happen.	logits	What analogy is used to explain logits (machine learning)?
An analogy to using logits in machine learning is viewing them as being like the odds of something happening. Just as with a coin toss, where there are two possible outcomes and each has an equal chance of occurring, the logit for either outcome is 0.5. In other words, if you see that a particular event has a logit of 0.3, that means that it's about three times more likely to happen than not happen.	logits	What analogy is used to explain logits (machine learning)?
Logits are analagous to probabilities, which can be thought of as measurements of how confident we are in our predictions. Just as there is a range of possible probabilities for any event, so too is there a range of possible logits	logits	What analogy is used to explain logits (machine learning)?
Logits are similar to the odds of something happening. Just as a person might say there is a one in ten chance of something happening, logits work in a similar way. They allow us to understand how likely it is that an event will happen, based on data and our predictions.	logits	What analogy is used to explain logits (machine learning)?
The explanation of log loss can be difficult to understand, but a good analogy is that it is similar to a person’s “bad luck” score. In life, some people seem to have all the bad luck and others appear to always have good luck. Log loss measures how unlucky a particular data point (or example) is when trying to learn from data.	log loss	What analogy is used to explain log loss (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a black box. Inputs are fed in, and outputs come out, but it’s tough to understand what goes on inside the black box. The goal is to find an analogy for log loss that will help us understand it better.One way to think about log loss is by comparing it to the “loss function” used in physics. In physics, the loss function is used to calculate how much energy is dissipated when two objects collide. You might think of this as a measure of how damaging the collision was.In machine learning, we use a similar concept called “error functions” or “loss functions” to calculate how well our model is doing at predicting outcomes. Just like with collisions in physics, we want our error function or loss function to be low (indicating that our predictions are accurate).	log loss	What analogy is used to explain log loss (machine learning)?
Log loss is most often compared to a teacher's grading system. It assigns negative points for incorrect answers and positive points for correct answers. The goal is to have as few negative points as possible, just like a good grade would be zero or positive.	log loss	What analogy is used to explain log loss (machine learning)?
The log loss function is a measure of how close the predicted value is to the actual value. It is used in many machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression and support vector machines.	log loss	What analogy is used to explain log loss (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain log loss is that it is the “error” in a machine learning model. Just as humans make mistakes, so too do machines. Log loss quantifies how much error a machine learning model makes in predicting outcomes. The lower the log loss, the more accurate the machine learning model is.	log loss	What analogy is used to explain log loss (machine learning)?
The analogy is that of betting. The log-odds of an event are the chances of it happening, represented as a negative number. This number reflects how much you would have to bet at even odds to break even. So, for example, if you think there is a 60% chance of something happening, then the log-odds would be -0.6 (because 0.6 x 2 = 1.2).	log-odds	What analogy is used to explain log-odds (machine learning)?
It is often helpful to think of log-odds as representing the “distance” between two points on a line. The distance is measured in terms of how many units (or standard deviations) separate the points from one another. This analogy can be helpful when understanding why adjusting for covariates (e.g., via regularization) can help reduce overfitting and improve generalization performance.	log-odds	What analogy is used to explain log-odds (machine learning)?
A good analogy to explain log-odds is betting on a horse race. Suppose you bet $10 on a horse that has 5:1 odds of winning. This means that for every $10 you bet, you can win $50 if the horse wins. The “log-odds” of this bet would be the natural logarithm of 50, which is 6.81. So in general, the higher the log-odds, the more likely it is that the event will happen.	log-odds	What analogy is used to explain log-odds (machine learning)?
The analogy to explain log-odds is that it is the number of bits needed to represent a probability.	log-odds	What analogy is used to explain log-odds (machine learning)?

LSTM is like a train station. The first set of cars (the inputs) come in and the last set of cars (the outputs) leave. The workers in the middle (the LSTM cells) change the composition of the trains as they go by, adding or removing cars, so that the output train is different from the input train.	long short-term memory (lstm)	What analogy is used to explain long short-term memory (lstm) (machine learning)?
LSTM is a bit like learning to ride a bicycle. You can keep your balance and move forward as long as you pedal. If you stop pedaling, you'll fall over.	long short-term memory (lstm)	What analogy is used to explain long short-term memory (lstm) (machine learning)?

A loss curve graphs how the error between the predicted results and actual results changes as more data is fed into a machine learning algorithm. The idea behind using a loss curve is that it allows you to see how well your model is doing at different points in time so that you can make corrections if needed.	loss curve	What analogy is used to explain loss curve (machine learning)?
The analogy used is often that of a hill. The learning algorithm starts off at the bottom of the hill, trying out different solutions and gradually making its way up. As it climbs, it finds better and better solutions until it eventually reaches the top. At this point, the algorithm has found the best possible solution to the problem.	loss curve	What analogy is used to explain loss curve (machine learning)?
A loss curve is a graphical representation of the error rates or losses for a machine learning algorithm as it learns from data.

The prediction is usually a number, but it could also be a boolean value (true or false), or even another machine learning algorithm.	loss surface	What analogy is used to explain loss surface (machine learning)?
A loss surface in machine learning is often compared to the landscape of a mountain range. Just as different elevations on a mountainside represent different fitness values for hikers, so too do different regions of the loss surface represent different fitness values for algorithms trying to learn how to correctly classify data. Like hikers traversing a mountain range, machine-learning algorithms try to find the path that leads to the lowest point on the loss surface (i.e., the best fit for their current set of training data).	loss surface	What analogy is used to explain loss surface (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain loss surface in machine learning is that it is like a map. The map will show you the different areas where your car can go and the different areas where your car cannot go. In the same way, the loss surface will show you how likely it is for your machine learning model to make a mistake on different types of data.	loss surface	What analogy is used to explain loss surface (machine learning)?
Loss Surface is often compared to the surface of a mountain. The loss function gives you an idea of how steep or flat the terrain is in different parts of the learning space.

The analogy is used to explain how a machine learning algorithm can learn to distinguish between different types of objects, for example cats and dogs. The algorithm begins with a set of data that consists of many images, some of which are pictures of cats and others which are pictures of dogs. It then creates a model that associates certain characteristics with each type of object. For example, the model may learn that cats have pointy ears, whereas dogs do not. When new images are fed into the system, the algorithm can use its model to determine whether or not they contain cats or dogs.	majority class	What analogy is used to explain majority class (machine learning)?
The analogy is that the majority class is like a big rock in a stream. The minority classes are like the pebbles that flow around the rock.	majority class	What analogy is used to explain majority class (machine learning)?

The analogy used to explain markov decision process (mdp) is that it is like a maze. The goal is to get from the starting point to the ending point, and along the way there are choices that need to be made. Each choice can lead you down one of several paths, and at each junction you have to choose which path to take. So it's like a maze where you can only go forward, and every decision affects the rest of your journey.	markov decision process (mdp)	What analogy is used to explain markov decision process (mdp) (machine learning)?
A decision maker is like a tourist visiting a new city for the first time. The tourist has to make decisions about what to do and where to go, but doesn't know what the consequences of those decisions will be. In the same way, a machine learning algorithm trying to learn how to optimize some criterion (e.g., minimize error) is making choices without knowing the exact outcome of each choice.	markov decision process (mdp)	What analogy is used to explain markov decision process (mdp) (machine learning)?
The analogy of a decision tree is used to explain MDP. The nodes in the tree represent different states, and the branches between the nodes represent different actions that can be taken from each state.

A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a set of weighted connections between input variables (X) and output variables (Y), where the weight of each connection represents the strength of the relationship between the two variables. The markov property states that, given a current state (X), the next state is only dependent on the current state and not on any past states. In other words, past experience does not affect future decisions.	markov property	What analogy is used to explain markov property (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a set of instructions for sorting through data and looking for patterns. The markov property is a mathematical theorem that helps ensure that the patterns found by these algorithms are reliable.	markov property	What analogy is used to explain markov property (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain the markov property of machine learning is as follows: Consider a waiter in a restaurant. Suppose that the waiter can remember the past behavior of each customer who has ever visited the restaurant. Over time, the waiter will observe that some customers tend to order certain items on their visits, while others have different preferences. The waiter will also notice that certain customers are more likely to visit the restaurant on particular days of the week or at particular times of day. However, even if the waiter knows all about a customer’s past behavior, he cannot predict with certainty what that customer will order on his next visit. This is because each customer’s ordering pattern is determined by a combination of his historical preferences and current circumstances (e.g., what else is being served). In this analogy, “customers” correspond to data points, “items ordered” correspond to features or predictions, and “days of week” or “times of day” correspond to conditions or contexts	markov property	What analogy is used to explain markov property (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is like a cookie recipe. The recipe specifies how to make a particular type of cookie, but it doesn't say what ingredients to use.

The notes from each person would then be combined to create a summary of the entire document.	multi-head self-attention	What analogy is used to explain multi-head self-attention (machine learning)?
Multi-head self-attention can be explained as an analogy to a person reading a book. When reading a book, the reader's attention is focused on different areas of the text depending on what they are trying to understand or remember. For example, if the reader is trying to understand the main point of a paragraph, their attention will be focused on the first and last sentences in that paragraph.

The analogy is that of a ballot box. In any election, each voter has several choices (e.g. candidates), and each vote can be cast for any one of them (or, more realistically, party/slate). The total number of votes is then tallied by candidate; this gives us the first-level result of the election. However, we might also be interested in knowing how individual voters voted: who got their support? To answer this question we need to look at the second-level results: what percentage of people voted for each candidate? This lets us see not just who won the most votes overall, but which candidates were supported by the greatest number or proportion of voters.Multinomial classification is similar: we have a set of input data (the ballots), and our goal is to determine which category each piece of data belongs to (candidate name).

A good analogy for non-response bias is to think about going to a restaurant. Suppose you go to a very popular restaurant on a weekend night and there is a line out the door.

However, suppose you go to the same restaurant on a weekday night when it is not as busy. You might be able to get seated right away and have your food within minutes. The difference between these two scenarios illustrates how selection bias can occur due to differences in demand (i.e., people who want to eat at the popular restaurant on a weekend night are different than those who want to eat at the same restaurant on a weekday night).	non-response bias	What analogy is used to explain non-response bias (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is treated as a black box. The user provides the algorithm with input data, and the algorithm outputs a prediction. However, there is no way to determine how the machine arrived at its prediction.	non-response bias	What analogy is used to explain non-response bias (machine learning)?
A common analogy to describe non-response bias in machine learning is the example of a person who owns a dog and a cat. If this person is asked whether they prefer dogs or cats, they are likely to say that they prefer dogs. However, if this person is then asked which animal they think is smarter, they may answer that cats are smarter because they own one. This demonstrates how someone's personal preferences can impact their responses when surveyed on specific topics.	non-response bias	What analogy is used to explain non-response bias (machine learning)?
A non-response bias is like a person who only ever wears blue clothing. If you were to ask them what colors they have, they would probably say blue. However, if you asked them about all the other colors in the world, they would be stumped. This is because they've never experienced those other colors firsthand -they've just seen them in pictures or heard descriptions of them from others. In the same way, a machine that has been trained on data with a non-response bias will be less likely to accurately predict outcomes for datasets without that bias.	non-response bias	What analogy is used to explain non-response bias (machine learning)?
A trainer in the gym might use the analogy of a weight machine to explain how an optimizer works. The trainer would say that the machine is like a computer, and it can be set to target certain goals, such as muscle growth or weight loss.	optimizer	What analogy is used to explain optimizer (machine learning)?
Optimizer is like a fitness instructor. It helps you to train your body and make it stronger, faster and more efficient.	optimizer	What analogy is used to explain optimizer (machine learning)?
The analogy of an optimizer is that it is like a fitness instructor. The fitness instructor helps you to improve your body and achieve the best physical shape possible.

They are constantly trying different techniques (turning the wheel, hitting the gas pedal, etc.) to see which one results in them getting closer and closer to their desired destination.	optimizer	What analogy is used to explain optimizer (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain out-group homogeneity bias is that people are more likely to remember the faces of people in their own group than they are the faces of people from other groups. This is because it is easier for our brains to process information that is familiar to us, and we tend to see differences between members of our own group and members of other groups as being more significant than they actually are.	out-group homogeneity bias	What analogy is used to explain out-group homogeneity bias (machine learning)?
When two people are introduced to each other and they exchange brief biographical information, the two people are likely to find some commonality in their lives. They may have both attended the same college or live in the same city. This is an example of in-group homogeneity bias. People tend to see similarities among members of their own group and differences between groups.	out-group homogeneity bias	What analogy is used to explain out-group homogeneity bias (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain out-group homogeneity bias (machine learning) is that people in an out-group are perceived as being more similar to each other than they actually are.	out-group homogeneity bias	What analogy is used to explain out-group homogeneity bias (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain out-group homogeneity bias in machine learning is that it is similar to the way humans naturally group things together. We see similarities among people within our own group, and differences between people in other groups. This occurs because we are more likely to pay attention to the things that make us different from others, rather than the things that we have in common.	out-group homogeneity bias	What analogy is used to explain out-group homogeneity bias (machine learning)?
Out-group homogeneity bias is the tendency for people to see out-groups as more similar to each other than they actually are. This analogy explains it using a group of animals. Imagine you are in a room with ten different animals: five horses, two dogs, one cat, one snake, and one llama. Even though there are ten different animals in the room, you might find that you see them all as equally horse-like. You might not spend very much time thinking about the differences between the dog and the cat, for example. This happens because when we see things as being part of a larger category (“animals”), we tend to think of them as being more similar to each other than they actually are.	out-group homogeneity bias	What analogy is used to explain out-group homogeneity bias (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a black box. We input data, the algorithm processes it and produces an output. In order to make sure that the algorithm is learning from our data and not just memorizing past examples, we need to constantly update its parameters. This analogy works well because in order to get accurate results from a black box, you need to keep tweaking the knobs on the back until you find the right setting.	parameter update	What analogy is used to explain parameter update (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a black-box function that takes in an input (x) and outputs a prediction (y). The parameter(s) of the machine learning algorithm are tweaked until the prediction is as accurate as possible.	parameter update	What analogy is used to explain parameter update (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a black box. The input is the data, and the output is the model. In order to improve our model, we need to give it feedback about how well it performs on new data. This is where the parameter update comes in. We take a step back and look at how well our model predicts outcomes on new data. Based on this information, we tweak the parameters of our model so that it does a better job predicting outcomes in the future.	parameter update	What analogy is used to explain parameter update (machine learning)?
A doctor might adjust the dosage of a medication after taking into account a patient's weight and age. In a similar way, machine learning algorithms can update their parameters after being exposed to new data.	parameter update	What analogy is used to explain parameter update (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain parameter update in machine learning is that it is like the tuning of a guitar. The parameters of a function are like the strings on a guitar, and by adjusting them, you can change how the function behaves. In machine learning, you can tweak the values of your parameters until you get the desired results.	parameter update	What analogy is used to explain parameter update (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a black box that takes in some data as input and produces some output. The goal is to figure out what the inside of the black box looks like so that we can understand how it works. To do this, we take a small piece of data from within the dataset and look at how the output changes when this piece of data is varied. We then plot this change against the position of the data within the dataset. This gives us a curve called a “partial derivative”.	partial derivative	What analogy is used to explain partial derivative (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a set of instructions for calculating a partial derivative. The input to the machine learning algorithm is a data set, and the output is a model that can be used to make predictions about future data.	partial derivative	What analogy is used to explain partial derivative (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is like a set of mathematical equations that can be used to calculate how different inputs affect the desired output. Just as you can use calculus to understand how changes in one variable (e.g., x) are related to changes in another variable (e.g., y), you can also use machine learning algorithms to understand how different inputs (e.g., features) are related to the desired output (e.g., classification labels).	partial derivative	What analogy is used to explain partial derivative (machine learning)?
As with many mathematical concepts, partial derivatives can be difficult to visualize. However, an analogy that may help is thinking of a function as a landscape. The x-axis could represent altitude, while the y-axis represents temperature. If we wanted to find the temperature at a specific location on the mountain (e.g., the summit), we would need to know both the altitude and temperature at every point along our path up to the summit. To find out just how hot it was at the summit, we would take partial derivatives of temperature with respect to altitude (∂T/∂x) and calculate the slope of that line. This tells us how much the temperature changes as we move up or down in elevation, but doesn't tell us anything about temperatures at other points on the mountain	partial derivative	What analogy is used to explain partial derivative (machine learning)?
A partial derivative is similar to taking a slice through a loaf of bread. It's a way of looking at one particular variable, while keeping all the other variables constant.	partial derivative	What analogy is used to explain partial derivative (machine learning)?
A common analogy used to explain participation bias in machine learning is that of a jury. If the jurors are not randomly selected from the population, but rather only those who have been summoned or have volunteered, the jury will be biased. This is because people who are more likely to respond (such as those with strong feelings about the case) are overrepresented, which can distort the results.	participation bias	What analogy is used to explain participation bias (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is like a teacher. A good teacher can see when students are struggling and give them more help. Likewise, a good machine learning algorithm can see when data is being misinterpreted and correct it.	participation bias	What analogy is used to explain participation bias (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is like a person who has never seen a cat before. If this person sees 10 cats, and someone tells them that all cats have four legs, the person will only remember that as truth because they experienced it firsthand. However, if they see 1,000 cats and someone tells them that all cats have four legs, the person may start to doubt whether or not this is actually true. This analogy illustrates how an algorithm can be biased towards certain types of data when it's "trained" on a set dataset.	participation bias	What analogy is used to explain participation bias (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is like a person who has never seen a cat before. If you show the person ten pictures of cats, and one picture of a dog, the person is going to be more likely to identify images of cats in future pictures, because they have been 'trained' with more examples of cats.	participation bias	What analogy is used to explain participation bias (machine learning)?
A biased coin has a higher chance of landing on heads than tails. This is an analogy for participation bias, which is when a machine learning algorithm favors some data points over others when learning from examples.	participation bias	What analogy is used to explain participation bias (machine learning)?
The partitioning strategy (machine learning) is often explained using the analogy of a teacher separating students into different groups.

An analogy that is often used to explain partitioning strategy in machine learning is dividing a classroom of students into two groups, one for boys and one for girls. The purpose of this division would be to teach the different subjects in a way that is more tailored to each group's interests and abilities.

The analogy of learning a new skill is often used to explain the process of performance (machine learning). It can be said that when someone first begins to learn a new skill, they are not very good at it. However, through repetition and continued practice, they become better and better at it. The same principle applies to machine learning; the more data that is fed into the system, the more accurate its predictions will be.	performance	What analogy is used to explain performance (machine learning)?

 perplexity is a measure of how surprised a machine learning algorithm is by the training data. It is a numerical value between 0 and 1 that indicates how well the algorithm can fit the data. A lower perplexity means that the algorithm is better able to predict values based on the training set.	perplexity	What analogy is used to explain perplexity (machine learning)?
A perplexity analogy for machine learning is a toddler who is trying to learn how to speak. The toddler knows some words and can put together simple sentences, but still doesn't understand the full complexities of language.

A pipeline is often used in machine learning as an analogy for how data flows through a series of transformations. Data enters the first stage of the pipeline, which may be called "pre-processing." The pre-processing stage might involve splitting the data into training and test sets, or cleaning up noisy data. The second stage might be called "feature extraction," where specific features of the data are identified and extracted. In some cases, additional pre-processing may be necessary to prepare the data for feature extraction. The third stage is typically "training" or "learning," where a model is fit to the training set using various algorithms. After training is complete, the fourth stage is "testing" or "evaluation," where the performance of the model on new data is evaluated.	pipeline	What analogy is used to explain pipeline (machine learning)?
Just as a pipe can transport water from one place to another, data pipelines can move and process data between different parts of a machine learning system.

Pipelining is the process of breaking a task down into a series of smaller tasks that can be executed simultaneously. This analogy can be used to explain how machine learning works. Machine learning algorithms are divided into two categories: training and inference. The training phase is where the algorithm learns from data. During the inference phase, the algorithm uses what it has learned to make predictions or decisions.	pipelining	What analogy is used to explain pipelining (machine learning)?
Just as a pipeline enables materials to be transported along its length with minimal disruption, so too does pipelining in machine learning enable multiple steps of the machine learning process to occur simultaneously.	pipelining	What analogy is used to explain pipelining (machine learning)?
The analogy is of a person who can only do one task at a time. If someone wants them to do three tasks, they have to wait for the first one to be completed before starting the second, and then the third. A machine that can do multiple tasks at once is like a pipeline where water flows through many different tubes all connected together. The water flows faster down the pipeline because it’s doing multiple things at the same time.	pipelining	What analogy is used to explain pipelining (machine learning)?
The analogy of machine learning pipelines is that it is similar to a conveyor belt in a factory. Raw materials are input at one end and the final product comes out the other.

Policy in machine learning is similar to the way a person would drive a car. The policy controls how the system behaves, much like a human driver controls their car.	policy	What analogy is used to explain policy (machine learning)?
The analogy of policy (machine learning) is a computer program. The computer program has been designed to do one task, for example, sorting an electronic spreadsheet. However, the same computer program can be used in different ways or for different tasks by changing its settings or "policy." For instance, you might use the same computer program to sort an alphabetized list of employees' names by department or to randomly order a group of objects. In both cases, the underlying computer code is still doing the same thing—sorting data—but it's being directed to do that in a different way based on changed settings (policies).	policy	What analogy is used to explain policy (machine learning)?
Policy is like a hand. The hand can move around and grasp things, and by doing so it can pick up objects. In the same way, policy in machine learning can be used to pick up objects or concepts in data.	policy	What analogy is used to explain policy (machine learning)?

This makes it easier to learn from and results in reduced processing time and memory requirements.	pooling	What analogy is used to explain pooling (machine learning)?
A group of people are each given a basket of apples. They are asked to count the number of apples in their baskets and then share this information with the rest of the group. After everyone has shared, the group calculates an average apple count for all the baskets. This is analogous to pooling in machine learning, where a number of individual 'learners' contribute their data (in this case, apple counts) and the algorithm pools this data together to create a more accurate overall average.	pooling	What analogy is used to explain pooling (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy for pooling is if you imagine a huge library with many books in it. If you want to find a certain book, you can search through the entire library yourself, or you can ask someone else to help you look for it. When two people are looking for the same book, they can work together to find it faster than either of them could by themselves. This is similar to how pooling works in machine learning – when several computers are working together to learn from data, they can do so more quickly and accurately than any one computer could on its own.	pooling	What analogy is used to explain pooling (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy for pooling is to think of it as a “student” who has been educated by a number of different teachers.

The prediction (machine learning) analogy is used to explain how a machine can be taught to make predictions by example. The analogy likens the machine learning process to a student being taught how to predict the outcome of a math problem by example. First, the student is given several examples of math problems with known outcomes. Then, the student is shown how to generalize from these examples and predict the outcome of new problems. Finally, the student is given additional practice problems so that they can improve their prediction skills.	prediction	What analogy is used to explain prediction (machine learning)?

Analogy: Think of a person who is terrible at predicting the future, but really enjoys playing the lottery. This person buys many lottery tickets, even though their chances of winning are very small. They do this because they enjoy dreaming about what they would do with the money if they won. In reality, this person is likely to lose money overall because their predictions are so poor. However, machine learning can still be useful for them in some ways. For example, if this person wanted to find out how much money they could expect to win on average by playing the lottery, machine learning could help them figure that out.	prediction bias	What analogy is used to explain prediction bias (machine learning)?

Just as you might use a filter to screen out unwanted objects from your view, machine learning can be used to identify patterns in data and predict future events.	prediction bias	What analogy is used to explain prediction bias (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is like a biased coin. The more you use it, the more accurate its predictions will be – but only if the bias remains consistent. If you flip a biased coin 10 times, it’s likely to come up heads six or seven times. But if you flip it 1,000 times, the number of heads and tails will be much closer to 500 each.	prediction bias	What analogy is used to explain prediction bias (machine learning)?
The analogy of predictive parity is that it is the equalization of two machines through prediction. In other words, each machine can make predictions about the other in order to achieve parity. Machine learning is used to achieve this goal by teaching one machine how to predict the behavior of another.	predictive parity	What analogy is used to explain predictive parity (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain predictive parity is that of a teacher. A good teacher makes predictions about how their students will perform in the future by taking into account their past performances and other factors. Machine learning algorithms are able to do something similar with large data sets, making predictions about future events or outcomes.	predictive parity	What analogy is used to explain predictive parity (machine learning)?
Predective parity is a machine learning analogy that is used to explain how predictive models can be created. A predictive model is a model that uses past data to predict future outcomes. In order to create a predictive model, you need two sets of data: one set of data that is used to train the model and one set of data that is used to test the model. The training set of data is used to teach the model how to predict outcomes, and the test set of data is used to see how well the model predictions match actual outcomes.	predictive parity	What analogy is used to explain predictive parity (machine learning)?
 predicting parity is similar to flipping a coin - the odds are always 50/50 of it landing on heads or tails. With predictive parity, you are using past data to make a prediction about an event that has yet to happen. Just like with flipping a coin, the more data you have, the better your predictions will be.	predictive parity	What analogy is used to explain predictive parity (machine learning)?
A predictive parity algorithm is like a teacher. The more data it has to work with, the better it becomes at predicting an outcome.	predictive parity	What analogy is used to explain predictive parity (machine learning)?
A good analogy for predictive rate parity is the way two friends might exchange movie ratings after seeing a film. If one person rates the movie a “9” and the other person rates it a “10,” then they would be said to have predictive rate parity because their ratings agree with each other almost perfectly. In machine learning, two models are in predictive rate parity when their predictions are equally accurate.	predictive rate parity	What analogy is used to explain predictive rate parity (machine learning)?
A good analogy to predictive rate parity is the game of pool. Imagine you are playing a game of pool with someone and your goal is to sink all of the balls in the table before your opponent does. In order to do this, you must first calculate where each ball will end up after being hit by your cue stick. This takes time and practice but eventually you become very good at it. Now imagine that instead of playing against another person, you are playing against a machine. The machine has been programmed to always sink the balls in the same order, no matter what. Even if you know where each ball will end up after being hit by the cue stick, there is no way for you to win because the machine will always beat you. Predictive rate parity prevents machines from becoming too dominant over humans in various tasks such as decision making and forecasting by ensuring that they only use rates that humans can also predict.	predictive rate parity	What analogy is used to explain predictive rate parity (machine learning)?
The analogy of predictive rate parity is to think about the weather. Just like we can make predictions about the weather a week in advance, we can also use machine learning algorithms to predict outcomes with similar accuracy—in this case, whether or not an email will be opened by a customer.	predictive rate parity	What analogy is used to explain predictive rate parity (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy for predictive rate parity would be that the predictions made by different models are statistically indistinguishable from one another. In other words, the models are calibrated to produce identical predictions on average. This is also known as "machine learning rate parity" or "predictive rate parity".	predictive rate parity	What analogy is used to explain predictive rate parity (machine learning)?
A popular analogy used to explain predictive rate parity is that of a person’s ability to learn in school. The more time someone spends learning, the better they will become at it. In the same way, machines that are given more data to process will be better able to predict outcomes.	predictive rate parity	What analogy is used to explain predictive rate parity (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a black box. The input is some data, and the output is a prediction. To use a machine learning algorithm, you need to feed it some data and tell it what to do with that data. This is called preprocessing.	preprocessing	What analogy is used to explain preprocessing (machine learning)?
Preprocessing is like getting your car ready for a long road trip. You fill up the gas tank, check the oil level, and make sure there's enough water in the radiator. In the same way, you need to preprocess your data before training a machine learning model. This includes cleaning up any messy data, encoding it into a format that the model can understand, and splitting it into trainable and test datasets.	preprocessing	What analogy is used to explain preprocessing (machine learning)?
A preprocessor in machine learning is similar to a compiler for programming languages. The compiler takes the code written in one language and converts it into bytecode or executable code that can run on a computer. In the same way, a preprocessor takes data in one format and prepares it for further processing by a machine learning algorithm.	preprocessing	What analogy is used to explain preprocessing (machine learning)?
The input data is like a huge jigsaw puzzle. Preprocessing is like sorting all the pieces into different boxes, so that when you start working on the puzzle, it's already organized and easier to put together.	preprocessing	What analogy is used to explain preprocessing (machine learning)?
Preprocessing is like making a pizza. The dough is the input, and the toppings are the features that you want to use for your analysis.	preprocessing	What analogy is used to explain preprocessing (machine learning)?
A pre-trained machine learning model is like a bicycle. It can be pedaled to help you get around, but it takes some time and effort to learn how to ride one. Once you know how to ride a bike, it's much easier to get around than if you had never ridden before. A pre-trained machine learning model is similar - it can be used to quickly perform certain tasks after being "trained" on a large set of data, but it may take some time and tweaking to get good results for a new task.	pre-trained model	What analogy is used to explain pre-trained model (machine learning)?
A pre-trained machine learning model is like a map. The map can be used to give directions from one place to another. The pre-trained machine learning model can be used to help predict something based on other information.	pre-trained model	What analogy is used to explain pre-trained model (machine learning)?
A pre-trained model is like a bicycle. It can be used to get from one place to another, but it takes someone with experience and training to use it in the most effective way.	pre-trained model	What analogy is used to explain pre-trained model (machine learning)?
A pre-trained machine learning model is like a person who has been to college and knows a lot of things. If you want to learn something, like how to speak Spanish, you can ask that person for help. The pre-trained machine learning model has already learned a lot of things, like how to identify objects in pictures or words in text. You can use these models to speed up your own machine learning process by using the knowledge they have already acquired.	pre-trained model	What analogy is used to explain pre-trained model (machine learning)?
The analogy that is typically used to explain pre-trained models in the machine learning community is that of a person who has already learned how to ride a bike. A pre-trained model is like someone who knows how to ride a bike and can teach others how to do it more quickly.	pre-trained model	What analogy is used to explain pre-trained model (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a weighted voting system. The weights are initially set to 0, and then updated according to the input data. In this way, the algorithm gradually learns which features of the data are most important.	prior belief	What analogy is used to explain prior belief (machine learning)?
An analogy is often used to explain prior belief in machine learning. This analogy likens the prior belief of a machine learner to that of a human. Just as humans have beliefs that are based on evidence, so too does a machine learner. The difference is that humans can explicitly recognize and understand the evidence on which their beliefs are based. A machine learner, however, relies on algorithms to identify relevant patterns in data and update its beliefs accordingly.	prior belief	What analogy is used to explain prior belief (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain prior belief is that it is like a coin. The coin has two sides, heads and tails. In machine learning, the coin would represent the data set. The head side of the coin would be the training data set and the tail side of the coin would be the test data set.	prior belief	What analogy is used to explain prior belief (machine learning)?
An analogy is used to explain prior belief (machine learning) as being like a weighted vote. The more evidence that is provided for or against a particular hypothesis, the greater the impact that evidence has on our belief in that hypothesis.	prior belief	What analogy is used to explain prior belief (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain prior belief is a voting machine. If you have ever voted, you know that after you feed your ballot into the machine, the screen displays how many votes have been cast for each candidate. The number of votes shown on the screen is not always an accurate representation of what will happen when all the ballots are counted, but it is still a pretty good indicator. In the same way, our prior beliefs (the number of votes displayed on the voting machine's screen) can be thought of as pretty good indicators of what we think is going to happen in reality (the total number of votes that will be counted).	prior belief	What analogy is used to explain prior belief (machine learning)?
A probabilistic regression model is like a teacher. The more data you give the teacher (the more examples of inputs and outputs), the better she becomes at predicting how new students will score on future tests.	probabilistic regression model	What analogy is used to explain probabilistic regression model (machine learning)?
The analogy for probabilistic regression model is that of a child learning to speak. The child hears people speaking around them and starts to imitate the sounds they hear. Over time, the child’s pronunciation becomes more accurate as they learn which sounds are associated with certain words. A probabilistic regression model works in a similar way, by learning from examples which produce the desired outcome.	probabilistic regression model	What analogy is used to explain probabilistic regression model (machine learning)?
A probabilistic regression model is a machine learning algorithm that estimates the probability of an outcome, such as whether or not a customer will churn, based on historical data. It can be thought of as a function that takes in input variables (e.g., customer age, tenure, account balance) and outputs the probability of an event happening (e.g., churning).	probabilistic regression model	What analogy is used to explain probabilistic regression model (machine learning)?
A probabilistic regression model is like a recipe. It is a set of instructions for transforming some input data into an estimate of some desired output.	probabilistic regression model	What analogy is used to explain probabilistic regression model (machine learning)?
A probabilistic regression model is like a recipe. The ingredients (features) are put into a pot, and the model spits out a prediction of how likely it is that someone will buy your product (the target variable).	probabilistic regression model	What analogy is used to explain probabilistic regression model (machine learning)?
Proxy is used to explain sensitive attributes (machine learning). It is an attribute that is not the real target of study, but rather a stand-in for it. Sensitive attributes are those that might reveal personal information or be damaging if revealed. For example, in order to study someone's voting preferences, their political affiliation might be used as a proxy instead. This would allow the researcher to study voting patterns without revealing any personal information about the participants.	proxy (sensitive attributes)	What analogy is used to explain proxy (sensitive attributes) (machine learning)?
Proxy is like a filter that sits in front of a machine learning algorithm. The proxy allows the algorithm to see only a limited number of attributes from the data set. This can be helpful when you want to protect sensitive information while still using machine learning for predictive modeling.	proxy (sensitive attributes)	What analogy is used to explain proxy (sensitive attributes) (machine learning)?
Proxy (sensitive attributes) can be explained as a person’s Facebook profile. A person’s Facebook profile contains sensitive information such as their name, age, gender, and contact information. However, this information is not the most important or relevant to understanding that person. Instead, their likes and interests are more important in determining who they are as a person. This is analogous to how machine learning works with proxy (sensitive) attributes. The proxy (sensitive) attributes are not necessarily the most important or relevant to understanding the data, but they are useful in predicting something else about the data.	proxy (sensitive attributes)	What analogy is used to explain proxy (sensitive attributes) (machine learning)?
Proxy (sensitive attributes) is used to explain machine learning as a way of understanding how computers learn from data. Just like humans learn best by example, computers can be taught to recognize patterns in data by being shown many different examples.	proxy (sensitive attributes)	What analogy is used to explain proxy (sensitive attributes) (machine learning)?
One analogy used to explain proxy (sensitive attributes) is that they are like fingerprints. Just as no two fingerprints are alike, no two people have the same set of proxy (sensitive attribute) values. This means that if someone wants to know your proxy (sensitive attribute), they would need access to your data in order to find out what it is.	proxy (sensitive attributes)	What analogy is used to explain proxy (sensitive attributes) (machine learning)?
Proxy labels are used in machine learning as a way to prevent overfitting on the training data. By using proxy labels, the model is able to learn more generalizable patterns that can be applied to new data. An analogy for this would be if someone is trying to learn how to play tennis. The person could use proxy labels by hitting balls against a wall and observing where they land. This would help them understand the trajectories of different types of swings and how best to return the ball back across the net.	proxy labels	What analogy is used to explain proxy labels (machine learning)?
Proxy labels are commonly used in machine learning as a way to improve the accuracy of algorithms. They can be thought of as stand-ins for the true values that we are trying to predict. For example, if we are trying to predict someone’s age, our proxy label might be their date of birth. This approach allows us to test different algorithms on data sets that contain known information about how accurately they can predict the target variable.	proxy labels	What analogy is used to explain proxy labels (machine learning)?
Proxy labels are used in machine learning to stand for other, more complex concepts. For example, if you are trying to predict whether someone will buy a product, you might use proxy labels such as "has purchased a similar product before" or "liked a related Facebook post." By using these proxies, you can build a model that is able to make predictions about whether someone will buy the product without needing access to their personal data.	proxy labels	What analogy is used to explain proxy labels (machine learning)?
Proxy labels are like a person’s fingerprints. Just as everyone has unique fingerprints, every machine learning model will produce slightly different results when it is “trained” on the same data. However, some models may be more similar to each other than others. When we want to know how well a model is performing, we can compare its predictions against the proxy labels that were generated by another model.	proxy labels	What analogy is used to explain proxy labels (machine learning)?
Proxy labels are used in machine learning to predict the class of an object by using other objects with known classes. This is similar to how a person may use their knowledge of other people's families to predict the family members of an individual they do not know.	proxy labels	What analogy is used to explain proxy labels (machine learning)?
A machine learning analogy for the q-function is a teacher grading student exams. The teacher first determines the average grade of all the exams and then grades each exam on how it compares to this average. The q-function assigns every example a score that measures how well it conforms to the distribution of training data.	q-function	What analogy is used to explain q-function (machine learning)?
The analogy to explain q-function is a vending machine. The q-function can be viewed as the probability that a particular type of soda will be dispensed from the vending machine given that it has been stocked with that type of soda.	q-function	What analogy is used to explain q-function (machine learning)?
Analogy to Statistical Mechanics: In statistical mechanics, the entropy of an interacting system of particles is a measure of the amount of uncertainty associated with the positions and momenta of the constituent particles. The higher the entropy, the more uncertain the behavior of the system. Analogously, in machine learning, q-function measures how much uncertainty there is about a classifier’s decision boundary given its training data. Higher q-values correspond to classifiers with more flexible decision boundaries that are better able to generalize to new data instances.	q-function	What analogy is used to explain q-function (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a black box that takes in input data (x) and produces an output (y).

A q-function is like a vending machine. In order to get a snack, you have to put in money and choose what you want. The q-function will give you the right snack depending on what you ask for.	q-function	What analogy is used to explain q-function (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain q-learning is that it is similar to being in a classroom. The teacher provides the student with examples of how to do something and then allows the student to practice on their own. After practicing, the student returns to the teacher for feedback and more instruction. This process repeats until the student has mastered the skill.	q-learning	What analogy is used to explain q-learning (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm that uses a gradient descent approach to learn the parameters of a function is called a q-learning algorithm. It can be thought of as an extension of the basic delta rule, which uses only the current error and recent input values in its calculations. The q-learning algorithm also incorporates knowledge about past errors and inputs, allowing it to better approximate the desired function.	q-learning	What analogy is used to explain q-learning (machine learning)?
A very common analogy for Q-learning is to think of it as a baby learning how to walk. Initially, the baby will just crawl around randomly. But over time, the baby will start to notice that when they move towards something they want (like a toy), they get closer to it, and when they move away from something they don’t want (like a dog), they get further away from it. The baby then starts to associate certain movements with desired outcomes, and begins walking towards things more often.	q-learning	What analogy is used to explain q-learning (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain q-learning is that of a dog learning how to fetch a ball. The dog continually tries different methods (actions) until it finds one that successfully brings the ball back (rewards). Over time, the dog becomes better at retrieving the ball by refining its action selection based on feedback received after each attempt. Q-learning is analogous to this process, with machines learning which actions lead to desired outcomes by adjusting their behavior in response to positive or negative feedback signals.	q-learning	What analogy is used to explain q-learning (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be compared to a person learning how to ride a bike. Initially, the person may not know how to ride at all. However, by trial and error they learn how to balance themselves on the bike and eventually they are able to ride without thinking about it. This is similar to what q-learning does; it allows machines to learn through experience so that they can make better decisions in the future.	q-learning	What analogy is used to explain q-learning (machine learning)?
Random forest is like a group of trees in a forest. The trees are planted close together and they grow tall and strong because of the support they get from their neighbors. Random forest works in a similar way. It is made up of many different decision trees that work together to make predictions. The trees in random forest are all randomly chosen, so it is able to learn patterns that are hidden in data sets.	random forest	What analogy is used to explain random forest (machine learning)?

A random forest is a machine learning algorithm that combines several decision trees into one.	random forest	What analogy is used to explain random forest (machine learning)?
A random forest is a machine learning technique that combines multiple decision trees. The individual trees in the forest are randomly grown, and each tree makes its own predictions independently of the others.	random forest	What analogy is used to explain random forest (machine learning)?
random forest is similar to a group of trees in a forest. The trees are planted close together and the branches grow intertwined. This creates a dense, thicket-like environment that is difficult for enemies (or anyone else) to penetrate.	random forest	What analogy is used to explain random forest (machine learning)?
Treating policy as a black box and only looking at the outcomes is like playing Russian roulette. You may get lucky and not have a bullet in the chamber, but eventually you're going to get shot.	random policy	What analogy is used to explain random policy (machine learning)?
The analogy of a drunkard's walk is used to explain the concept of random policy in machine learning. A drunken person walks randomly and without any real purpose, making it difficult to predict their movements. In the same way, a machine learning algorithm with a random policy will make unpredictable choices that are not based on any pattern or trend.	random policy	What analogy is used to explain random policy (machine learning)?
The analogy of a tornado in a junkyard is used to explain how machine learning works. The tornado is the algorithm and the junkyard is the data.	random policy	What analogy is used to explain random policy (machine learning)?
A good analogy for random policy is a drunk person trying to walk home. They may end up going the right way, but they are also just as likely to end up going in the opposite direction or taking a longer route than necessary.	random policy	What analogy is used to explain random policy (machine learning)?
A common analogy for random policy is to think of it as a drunken driver. A drunk driver has no plan when they get behind the wheel and is just going to wherever their car takes them. This is similar to how a machine learning algorithm with random policy will just follow whatever pattern it observes in the training data.	random policy	What analogy is used to explain random policy (machine learning)?
A rater is a machine learning algorithm that predicts the probability of an event, such as whether or not an email will be marked as spam.	rater	What analogy is used to explain rater (machine learning)?
A computer is like a brain. It can learn how to do things by example.	rater	What analogy is used to explain rater (machine learning)?
Rater is the process of teaching computers to make decisions by example. This is done by giving a computer a large number of examples, or "training data," and telling it which decision is correct for each one. The computer then uses this information to make its own decisions in the future.	rater	What analogy is used to explain rater (machine learning)?
The analogy of a rater is that it is like a teacher. A machine learning algorithm "learns" by being constantly fed new data, which it then uses to improve its performance on predicting what will happen in the future. Just as a student would learn more over time by being exposed to different teachers and subjects, a machine learning algorithm gets better at predicting outcomes by being given more data.	rater	What analogy is used to explain rater (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain rater is that it is like a human brain. The computer is taught how to recognize different objects and then it will be able to identify those same objects in new pictures or videos that are given to it.	rater	What analogy is used to explain rater (machine learning)?
A good analogy to think of a recommender system as is if you imagine yourself going on vacation. Before you go, you might ask your friends and family for recommendations of where to go. Once you have a few places in mind, you might do some research online to see what other people are saying about those destinations. Finally, once you’ve made your decision,you might check out some reviews of the hotels or restaurants that will be included in your trip. A recommender system works similarly – it takes input (in this case, items like movies, books or products) and uses algorithms to find patterns in data (e.g., who likes what) in order to recommend similar or recommended items to users	recommendation system	What analogy is used to explain recommendation system (machine learning)?
If you think of a human brain as a computer, then the inputs are all of the things that come into your eyes and ears, and the outputs are what you say or do. In between, there is a lot of processing going on in your brain that determines how you act. A recommendation system is like this too: it takes in all sorts of data about what people have liked in the past (including what other people have liked about those items) and uses algorithms to figure out which new items might be good for you to check out.	recommendation system	What analogy is used to explain recommendation system (machine learning)?
A doctor may make a recommendation to a patient after studying the patient's medical history. A computer may make a recommendation to a customer after studying that person's purchase history.	recommendation system	What analogy is used to explain recommendation system (machine learning)?
A machine learning system is like a group of people who have never met before, but who are all experts in different subjects. The system can be given a question about something, and it will find the best person to answer that question, by looking through its database of experts and finding the one with the most relevant expertise.	recommendation system	What analogy is used to explain recommendation system (machine learning)?
A good analogy to explain a recommendation system (machine learning) is the way you might suggest books to someone. Imagine that you are talking to a friend who tells you they enjoy reading. You might then say, "have you read any of the Harry Potter series?" If your friend says no, then you might recommend that they start with the first book in the series. If your friend says yes, then you might recommend that they read the newest book in the series.	recommendation system	What analogy is used to explain recommendation system (machine learning)?

An analogy used to explain regularization rate (machine learning) is the use of a training bra. A training bra helps new mothers adjust to the changes their body will go through when they start breastfeeding. The bra provides gentle pressure and limits how much milk can be released, which allows the mother’s breasts time to adapt to producing milk. Without the training bra, too much milk would be released at once, and it would be difficult for the mother’s body to produce enough milk for her baby in the long term.	regularization rate	What analogy is used to explain regularization rate (machine learning)?
The analogy is of a person trying to learn how to ski. At first they are extremely wobbly and fall all the time, but with practice their skiing improves until they can ski down the mountain with ease.

RL analogy: learning to play a game of chess. At the beginning, you are given some basic rules and then start playing against opponents who are also learning. Over time, you keep playing and get better at the game as your opponent’s moves become more predictable. Eventually you reach a level where you can beat most people without much difficulty – this is analogous to reaching a high level of performance in RL tasks.	reinforcement learning (rl)	What analogy is used to explain reinforcement learning (rl) (machine learning)?
Reinforcement learning is a machine learning technique that enables an agent to learn how to achieve a desired goal or outcome by observing the outcomes of its own actions. The analogy that is often used to explain reinforcement learning is that it is similar to how children learn. Children observe the consequences of their actions (reinforcement) and then adapt their behavior accordingly in order to achieve a desired outcome (such as getting a toy they want).	reinforcement learning (rl)	What analogy is used to explain reinforcement learning (rl) (machine learning)?

The machine learning analogy for a replay buffer is that it is like a cache of past experiences. The buffer stores recent experiences so that they can be quickly recalled and used to improve the performance of the machine learning algorithm. This makes the machine learning algorithm more efficient by allowing it to learn from past mistakes and successes without having to repeatedly go through all of the data again.	replay buffer	What analogy is used to explain replay buffer (machine learning)?
The replay buffer analogy is used to explain machine learning by comparing it to a video recorder. The VCR records the program that is being watched and stores it in the replay buffer. If there is a power outage or the viewer wants to watch the program again, they can rewind to the beginning of the program and watch it from start to finish without interruption. The machine learning algorithm works in a similar way. It records all of the data that is input into it and stores it in memory. If there is a power outage or the user wants to see what happened earlier, they can go back and review past data without losing any information.	replay buffer	What analogy is used to explain replay buffer (machine learning)?

The analogy is that of a filter. In machine learning, bias refers to the way in which a particular algorithm or model will favor some data points over others when it’s making decisions. This can result in unfair outcomes and lead to inaccurate predictions.	reporting bias	What analogy is used to explain reporting bias (machine learning)?
Reporting bias is introduced in machine learning as a form of distortion, similar to how noise can distort an image. In many cases, data that is used to train a model may be different from the data that is used to evaluate the model’s performance. This introduces bias into the evaluation process, which can lead to inaccurate results.	reporting bias	What analogy is used to explain reporting bias (machine learning)?
Reporting bias is like when a computer only reports the information that it is given. If you give the computer biased information then it will report back biased results.	reporting bias	What analogy is used to explain reporting bias (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain representation is that it is like a map. The map represents the terrain in a certain way, and we can use it to plan our journey.

A popular analogy used to explain machine learning is that it is like a child learning how to recognize objects. At first, the child knows only basic properties of objects such as shape, color, and size. With time and experience, the child begins to learn more nuanced information about objects- for example, that an apple is a type of fruit, or that a cat has fur. Machine learning algorithms work in a similar way: they start with general information about data (e.g., that all instances of red apples are also fruits) and then learn more specific details by observing examples (e.g., that some green apples are also fruits).	representation	What analogy is used to explain representation (machine learning)?
A computer is like a brain. It can’t learn on its own, but it can be taught. After being shown a bunch of images of animals, for example, the computer will be able to recognize different types of animals in new pictures.	representation	What analogy is used to explain representation (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain machine learning is that it is like a child’s brain. The child’s brain is constantly taking in new information and trying to make connections between different pieces of information.

Re-ranking is similar to the game of chess. In both cases, there are a number of possible moves that can be made, and the player must decide on the best one. With re-ranking, a computer is given a number of potential responses to a question and must determine which is the best answer.	re-ranking	What analogy is used to explain re-ranking (machine learning)?
One analogy for machine learning is that it is like a fitness trainer. The fitness trainer watches you as you work out, and notes which exercises are most effective for improving your fitness level. Based on this information, the fitness trainer will then re-rank the order of the exercises in your workout routine to optimize your results.	re-ranking	What analogy is used to explain re-ranking (machine learning)?
The example of a person's job hunt is often used to explain the concept of re-ranking in machine learning. When a person applies for jobs, they send their resume to potential employers. The resumes are then ranked by the employers based on how well they match the requirements of the position. However, if someone does not get a job that they applied for, they can revise their resume and send it to other employers who may be interested in them. In this case, the ranking of the resumes changes based on whether or not the applicant gets a job.	re-ranking	What analogy is used to explain re-ranking (machine learning)?
A common analogy used to explain re-ranking is that of a person sorting through a stack of resumes. Initially, the applicant with the most relevant qualifications will be at the top of the resume pile. However, if someone else more qualified applies for the same job, then the applicant's resume will be moved to the bottom of the pile - or even rejected altogether. In machine learning, "re-ranking" refers to algorithms that can improve on an initial ranking based on new information (e.g., additional data points or updated feedback).	re-ranking	What analogy is used to explain re-ranking (machine learning)?
It is often said that machine learning is like riding a bicycle. You may not know how to ride when you start, but with practice you will get better.

Analogy of a vending machine:A vending machine is an example of a simple return system. When you put money in the machine, it gives you back a product. The product could be a can of soda or candy bar. The important thing to remember is that the machine only gives you what you ask for when you put in the money. It doesn't give you anything else and it doesn't give back your money unless there's something wrong with the product.	return	What analogy is used to explain return (machine learning)?
The analogy of a machine learning algorithm is that it is like a student in school. The better the student learns and understands, the more they are able to apply their knowledge and get better grades.

A possible analogy for reward in machine learning is a person's salary. A person's salary is one potential reward that can motivate them to work.

An analogy used to explain reward (machine learning) is that it is like a slot machine. In order for the machine to keep giving rewards (payouts), it must be kept fed with coins (input).	reward	What analogy is used to explain reward (machine learning)?
The analogy of a slot machine is often used to explain reward (machine learning). When someone pulls the lever of a slot machine, they are hoping to get a payout – in the form of money or some other prize. Machine learning algorithms work in a similar way: they are given input data (the lever pulled by the user), and they produce an output (a payout). The difference is that instead of giving out physical rewards, machine learning algorithms give out digital rewards, such as points or likes.	reward	What analogy is used to explain reward (machine learning)?

In other words, it is a technique that can be used to reduce the influence of individual observations on the estimate of a regression coefficient.	ridge regularization	What analogy is used to explain ridge regularization (machine learning)?

Ridge regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting of the model to the training data. It can be thought of as a way of adding some "smoothing" or "regularizing" noise to the model so that it is less likely to perfectly match the training data and instead will better fit the overall distribution of data.	ridge regularization	What analogy is used to explain ridge regularization (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a function, which takes in an input (in this case, a string of text), and outputs the most likely next character in the sequence.	rnn	What analogy is used to explain rnn (machine learning)?
RNN is an acronym for “recurrent neural network.” It is a machine learning algorithm that is particularly good at recognizing patterns in data that are sequential in nature. An analogy to help explain how RNN works might be to think of it as a computerized version of the human brain. The human brain can easily recognize patterns in sequences of words or images because it has been exposed to them over and over again. A recurrent neural network operates similarly, by learning from past experiences and recognizing patterns within data sets that are repeated over time.	rnn	What analogy is used to explain rnn (machine learning)?
One analogy for RNNs is to think of them as a type of “memory”. Just as you might remember things from your past, an RNN can remember patterns in data it has seen before.	rnn	What analogy is used to explain rnn (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a black box that takes an input (in this case, a string of text) and produces an output (a prediction).

The rmse is the average of the squared errors between the predictions and the actual values. The analogy that is most often used to explain this concept is that of a student's test scores. Imagine that a student has taken three tests and their scores are as follows: 95, 90, and 85. The mean score for these three tests would be 91 (add up all of the scores and divide by how many tests were taken). However, if we want to know more about this student's performance, we might be interested in looking at their individual scores relative to the mean. In other words, what was their deviation from the mean on each test? This is where the rmse comes in. To calculate it, we square each deviation (subtracting the mean from each score and then dividing by N-1), add them all up, and then take the square root of that sum. So in our example,the rmse would be 5.14 ((95-91)^2 + (90-91)^2 + (85-91)^2)/3).	root mean squared error (rmse)	What analogy is used to explain root mean squared error (rmse) (machine learning)?
This analogy is used to explain root mean squared error (rmse) (machine learning): imagine you are a carpenter and your job is to make a wooden frame that will fit inside of another wooden frame. The first, or inner, frame is the one you build and the second, or outer, frame is given to you. You want the inner frame to be as close as possible in size to the outer one. This would be your goal for minimizing rmse-the difference between the sizes of the two frames.	root mean squared error (rmse)	What analogy is used to explain root mean squared error (rmse) (machine learning)?

Suppose you want to know how physically attractive you are on a scale from 1-10, with 1 being very unattractive and 10 being very attractive. You could ask your friends or family what they think, but their opinions may not be entirely unbiased. Another option would be to take pictures of yourself in different poses and compare them to pictures of other people who have been rated as having a score of 10. By comparing your pictures to the pictures of other people, you can get an objective measure of your attractiveness relative to others. In the same way, RMSE provides an objective measure of how close predictions are to the actual values.	root mean squared error (rmse)	What analogy is used to explain root mean squared error (rmse) (machine learning)?
Bootstrapping is a popular technique in statistics for estimating the distribution of a statistic from a limited number of samples. It works by randomly sampling with replacement from the data set to create new data sets, each time computing the statistic of interest.

The analogy is used to explain that a machine learning algorithm is able to learn the same thing no matter where it is applied. Just as a rotational invariant object (like a circle) looks the same from all angles, a machine learning algorithm will perform the same function regardless of where in the data set it is applied.	rotational invariance	What analogy is used to explain rotational invariance (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is like a rotational invariant function. Just as a rotation of an object around a fixed point does not change its appearance, so too a small change in the input (training data) to a machine learning algorithm produces only a small change in the output. This allows for reliable generalization from training data to new instances.	rotational invariance	What analogy is used to explain rotational invariance (machine learning)?
Sampling bias is like a person who only eats junk food and therefore has an inaccurate view of the average American diet. This person would likely think that Americans eat mostly unhealthy foods, when in reality, most Americans eat a balanced diet.	sampling bias	What analogy is used to explain sampling bias (machine learning)?
A biased coin will come up heads more often than tails. This is an analogy for sampling bias in machine learning, which is when a machine learner favors some data samples over others, leading to inaccurate predictions.	sampling bias	What analogy is used to explain sampling bias (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a black box that takes in some input data (the training set) and produces an output (a prediction or classification). The purpose of the machine learning algorithm is to learn from the training set so that it can generalize to new data. The problem with this approach is that there is no guarantee that the machine learning algorithm will perform well on new data. This is because the performance of a machine learning algorithm depends on the quality of the training set, which may not be representative of all data. In other words, if the training set is biased then the resulting predictions or classifications will also be biased.	sampling bias	What analogy is used to explain sampling bias (machine learning)?
A biased coin has a higher chance of landing on heads than tails. This is an analogy for sampling bias, which is when a sample population does not accurately reflect the larger population from which it was drawn.

Asking people who are interested in your topic to contribute to a survey is like picking cherries from a cherry tree. The cherries that you pick will be the ripest and most delicious because they were picked by someone who was looking for ripe cherries.	sampling bias	What analogy is used to explain sampling bias (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a scalar because it takes in input data, processes that data, and produces an output. Just as a scalar value is simple (it has only a magnitude), so too is a machine learning algorithm simple in the sense that it operates on a single input to produce a single output.	scalar	What analogy is used to explain scalar (machine learning)?
A scalar is a number, like 5. A machine learning algorithm can learn to associate certain input data with this number.

Machine learning can be thought of as a "small world" phenomenon. Just as the small world phenomenon describes how people are more likely to know others who are linked by just a few degrees of separation, machine learning algorithms rely on connections between data points that are closer together in space or time for predictions.	scaling	What analogy is used to explain scaling (machine learning)?
One analogy used to explain scaling is the story of a small town that decides to build a factory. The town's residents are excited about the prospects of more jobs and economic growth. But as they begin to plan for the factory, they realize they will need more space. They'll also need more utilities, like water and electricity, to support the factory. And they'll need more people to work in the factory. As they continue planning, they realize that in order for the factory to be successful, it needs to be much bigger than their small town.This analogy can be applied to machine learning algorithms. Just as the small town needed a bigger space for their factory, machine learning algorithms need more data (space) in order to be trained and perform well. Additionally, just as the town needed more utilities like water and electricity to support the factory, machine learning algorithms require access to large amounts of computing power (electricity). And finally, just as the town needed more people working in their factory, machine learning algorithms require large numbers or training data (workers).	scaling	What analogy is used to explain scaling (machine learning)?
An analogy used to explain scaling is the idea of a small pond. A small pond can easily be surveyed by someone standing on its banks. If you want to study the behavior of fish in the pond, it's easy to toss in some food and watch what happens. You can also wade into the water and get a closer look at the fish. But if you want to understand how the fish in that pond interact with each other and their environment, you need to enlarge the pond so that it better represents their ecosystem. The larger pond will still have limitations (it won't include all of the environmental variables), but it will allow you to see interactions between more fish and explore different parts of the ecosystem.In machine learning, scale refers both to increasing or decreasing sample size (the number of observations) as well as increasing or decreasing computational power (the number of computations that can be done). Both are important for getting accurate results; increasing either one without corresponding changes in the other may lead to inaccurate models	scaling	What analogy is used to explain scaling (machine learning)?
As the size of a data set increases, the number of unique permutations (or combinations) of that data also increases. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as combinatorial explosion.	scaling	What analogy is used to explain scaling (machine learning)?

An analogy to scoring is found in sports. In football, for example, a team earns points by running or passing the ball into the opposing team's end zone. Similarly, in machine learning, algorithms earn "points" by correctly classifying instances (e.g., predicting whether an email is spam or not). The goal of a machine learning algorithm is to earn as many points as possible during each iteration of the learning process.	scoring	What analogy is used to explain scoring (machine learning)?
A scorer is like a teacher. The scorer assigns points to each answer (like A, B, C, D), and the more points an answer gets, the better it is. This process lets the machine learn which answers are correct and incorrect.	scoring	What analogy is used to explain scoring (machine learning)?
In scoring, a machine learning algorithm is given a set of training data and it produces a model. The model can then be used to predict how likely it is that an input belongs to a particular class. For example, if you are trying to predict whether or not someone will default on their loan, the score could be based on factors such as credit history and income.	scoring	What analogy is used to explain scoring (machine learning)?
A good analogy to scoring is voting. In a democracy, every vote counts the same, no matter whom or what you are voting for. With machine learning, each data point is like a vote and the algorithm is like the politician who wants to get elected. The more data points that support your hypothesis (the better), the more likely it is that your hypothesis will be “elected” by the machine learning algorithm.	scoring	What analogy is used to explain scoring (machine learning)?
An analogy is used to explain scoring (machine learning). The scored output of a machine learning algorithm can be thought of as how well it did on the task at hand, analogous to a student’s grade. Just like students, algorithms can be graded on a bell curve where most are in the middle and fewer are either very good or very bad.	scoring	What analogy is used to explain scoring (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm is like a funnel. The more data you put in the top, the more accurate your predictions will be. However, if you only put in biased data, your machine learning algorithm will be biased too.	selection bias	What analogy is used to explain selection bias (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain selection bias (machine learning) is as follows: Think of a classroom with 30 students. If you wanted to know the average height of people in the room, you would not ask only the tallest person to stand up and measure their height. This would give you an inaccurate estimate of the average height because it would be biased towards tall people. To get a more accurate estimate, you would need to measure everyone in the room. The same is true for machine learning; if you want to learn something about a population, it’s important not to rely on biased data.	selection bias	What analogy is used to explain selection bias (machine learning)?
The analogy of machine learning selection bias is using a magnifying glass to look at an ant on the ground. The ant looks bigger because you are looking at it through the magnifying glass. Selection bias in machine learning happens when a data set is selected for use in training or testing a model and results in an inaccurate model.	selection bias	What analogy is used to explain selection bias (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be compared to a person who is trying to learn how to play the game of chess. The person might start by playing against people who are bad at chess, so they would easily win. This would create a bias in the person's training data, because they only played against weaker players and did not get practice playing against better players. This analogy illustrates how selection bias can distort our understanding of how well a machine learning algorithm is performing.	selection bias	What analogy is used to explain selection bias (machine learning)?
A selection bias (machine learning) is when a machine filter out some information during the learning process, which can result in inaccurate predictions. For example, if a machine only learns from data that has been labeled as "positive", it might be more likely to incorrectly predict that a new input is also positive.	selection bias	What analogy is used to explain selection bias (machine learning)?

One analogy is that a self-attention layer is like reading text aloud. The reader’s attention will naturally be drawn to the most important parts of the sentence, and they will focus on those parts as they read.	self-attention (also called self-attention layer)	What analogy is used to explain self-attention (also called self-attention layer) (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain self-attention layer is that it is similar to the process of reading a book. When you are reading a book, you are paying attention to what is happening in the text in front of you as well as what is happening in your own mind.

A common analogy used to explain self-training (machine learning) is that of a child learning how to speak. A parent does not explicitly teach their child every word in the English language, but instead exposes them to different situations and conversations where they learn new words implicitly.

A machine learning analogy for softmax is that it is similar to a hotel check-in process. When a customer arrives at a hotel, the front desk clerk checks in the customer and then assigns them a room. The front desk clerk then prints out a key card for the room and hands it to the customer.

The softmax function is a mathematical function used in machine learning to calculate the probability of a particular event occurring. It is often used when trying to predict the most likely outcome of several possible outcomes. The analogy that is commonly used to explain how the softmax function works is that it is like a lottery.

An analogy to explain sparse feature is that it is like when you are trying to find your car in a large parking lot. You may only see a few cars at a time, but as you keep looking, you will eventually see your car. In the same way, with machine learning, if you have many features (cars), but only a few of them are important (the ones that are close to your car), then the algorithm can find the important features very quickly.	sparse feature	What analogy is used to explain sparse feature (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a function that takes in an input, such as a photo, and outputs a prediction about what the photo is of. The prediction might be something like “dog” or “cat”.	sparse feature	What analogy is used to explain sparse feature (machine learning)?
The most common analogy to explain sparse feature is the image of a camel. A camel has two humps, and each hump is relatively large in comparison to the size of the camel's body as a whole.

This is similar to how features work in machine learning - some features (humps) are more important than others (legs), and they are all relative to the size of the overall problem.	sparse feature	What analogy is used to explain sparse feature (machine learning)?
Sparse feature is explained using the analogy of a person who is trying to learn a new language. In order to learn the language, they need to be exposed to new words and phrases on a regular basis.

Similarly, the neural network has many connections, but only a few are actually used at any given time.	sparse representation	What analogy is used to explain sparse representation (machine learning)?
An analogy used to explain sparse representation is that it is similar to storing a library of books. If you have a small library with only 10 books, then you can store the entire library in your head. However, if you have a large library with 1000 books, then you cannot store the entire library in your head and will need to find another way to remember the information.

Sparse vector is used to explain machine learning in a way that is easy for beginners to understand. It can be thought of as similar to the distribution of stars in space. Just as there are vast areas of space where few, if any, stars can be found, there are also vast areas of data where few, if any, instances of a target variable exist. Data scientists must learn to identify and focus on these sparse regions when modeling predictive analytics problems.	sparse vector	What analogy is used to explain sparse vector (machine learning)?
A example of a sparse vector is when you have a list of words and each word only appears once, even though the list has 10 words.

A sparse vector is best analogous to a list of phone numbers in which many are not dialed. The more frequently a number is called, the more likely it is that it will be stored in memory. Similarly, for a machine learning algorithm, the more often a particular feature appears in the training data, the more likely that feature will be "remembered" and used by the algorithm when making predictions.	sparse vector	What analogy is used to explain sparse vector (machine learning)?
Sparse vector (machine learning) is often compared to a library. A library has many books, but only a few people who use them.

If you go to any large city, you are likely to find many people who suffer from some common ailment like the flu or a cold. However, if you visit a small town in the middle of nowhere, you are much more likely to find someone suffering from a rare disease. The same principle applies to machine learning; data collected from smaller and more specialized datasets will be much sparser than data collected from larger, general-purpose datasets.	sparsity	What analogy is used to explain sparsity (machine learning)?
A good analogy to explain sparsity is the example of a library. A library has many books, but only a few people who check them out. The same is true for machine learning; there are many patterns to be learned, but only a few that are actually used.	sparsity	What analogy is used to explain sparsity (machine learning)?
A good analogy for sparsity is the number of people who show up to a party. If only 10 people RSVP for a party that can accommodate 100 guests, then the party is sparsely attended.

A good analogy for sparsity is the human brain. The human brain has a huge number of neurons, but only a small fraction of them are active at any given time. Similarly, machine learning algorithms can be applied to huge data sets, but only a small fraction of the data will be useful in predicting future events.	sparsity	What analogy is used to explain sparsity (machine learning)?

A machine learning analogy for spatial pooling is that it is like stirring a pot of soup. The goal is to make the soup more flavorful by stirring it up and combining the ingredients. In the same way, spatial pooling combines features from different parts of an image so that they can be processed together. This makes the overall image easier to understand and recognize.	spatial pooling	What analogy is used to explain spatial pooling (machine learning)?
A common analogy for squared hinge loss used in machine learning is the concept of astudent's grade point average (GPA). In order to calculate a student's GPA, the grades they have received in all of their classes are totaled and then each grade is weighted by the number of credits that class earned. The sum of all these weighted grades is divided by the total number of credits taken, resulting in the student's GPA.Similar to this analogy, squared hinge loss uses weighted values to calculate how well a machine learning algorithm has performed on its training data. The sum of these weights is then divided by the total number of samples used in training, resulting in a metric called "loss". This value can be used to help determine how effective an algorithm is at generalizing from its training data set to new data.	squared hinge loss	What analogy is used to explain squared hinge loss (machine learning)?
The analogy to explain squared hinge loss is that it is similar to the way in which a weightlifter loses muscle mass when they stop lifting weights. In both cases, there is a gradual decrease in performance as the muscles are not used.	squared hinge loss	What analogy is used to explain squared hinge loss (machine learning)?
Railroad switches are a good analogy for squared hinge loss. When a train is coming down the tracks, it's important to have the switch set in the right direction so that the train goes where you want it to go. If you don't set the switch correctly, the train will crash and cause a lot of damage. Hinge loss works in a similar way. You can think of it as a kind of "error" or "wasted energy." If you're trying to predict something (like whether or not someone is going to buy your product), and your prediction is wrong, then you've lost some information (just like if you were trying to move a train from one track to another and missed). The more times your predictions are wrong, the more information you lose - just like with railroad switches.	squared hinge loss	What analogy is used to explain squared hinge loss (machine learning)?
Returning to our hinge loss function from earlier, we can think of the squared hinge loss as being similar to the cost associated with a mistake made when trying to fold a piece of paper in half. If you try folding the paper and it doesn’t quite make it all the way across, you end up with a crease in the middle that’s twice as wide as if you had successfully folded the paper in half. In much the same way, if our machine learning algorithm makes a mistake while trying to learn how to identify objects in an image or determine someone’s age based on their face, that mistake will result in a squared hinge loss that’s twice as large as if the algorithm had correctly identified the object or age.	squared hinge loss	What analogy is used to explain squared hinge loss (machine learning)?

A simple analogy for squared loss is weightlifting. Assume you want to increase your muscle mass and so you begin a weightlifting program. Initially, your muscles are weak and it takes a lot of effort (and energy) to lift even the lightest weights. But as you continue lifting weights, your muscles grow stronger and it becomes easier to lift heavier weights; in fact, the more weight you lift, the greater your muscle mass will become. So, with each workout, not only do you make progress towards reaching your overall goal (increased muscle mass), but you also measure that progress by seeing how much easier it has become to lift ever-heavier weights. This incremental progression is analogous to squared loss in machine learning: we not only measure our overall error rate (e.g., percentage of incorrect predictions), but we also track how much that error rate decreases with each iteration of the learning algorithm."	squared loss	What analogy is used to explain squared loss (machine learning)?
The analogy is that of a gambler at a casino. The gambler makes bets, and some bets result in winnings and others in losses. The goal is to make more winning bets than losing ones, so the total amount won (or lost) is positive (or negative). In the same way, if we are trying to learn something from data (e.g., classify items into categories), our "loss function" tells us how bad it is when we make mistakes: the bigger the loss function value, the worse the mistake. We want to minimize this loss function value over time, just as the gambler wants to minimize their total losses.	squared loss	What analogy is used to explain squared loss (machine learning)?
In machine learning, squared loss is often compared to a gambler's ruin. In the analogy, each decision an algorithm makes can be thought of as a bet.

Analogy of learning a new language: the more you use it, the better you become at using it.	training	What analogy is used to explain training (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain training is that it is like teaching a child. The child needs to be taught the basics, such as how to speak and read, before they can learn more complex tasks.

Machine learning is like a baby. The more you feed it, the smarter it gets.	training	What analogy is used to explain training (machine learning)?
One analogy often used to explain the process of machine learning is that it is similar to how a human learns. When a baby is born, it does not come into the world knowing how to speak or walk. It gradually learns these skills as it interacts with its environment. In much the same way, a machine learning algorithm starts off with no knowledge of the task at hand. But through repeated exposure to data, it gradually becomes better at performing the task.	training	What analogy is used to explain training (machine learning)?
The trajectory of a machine learning algorithm can be thought of as the path that it follows while trying to learn how to perform a task. This path is determined by the algorithm's parameters, which control how it behaves. The trajectory can be viewed as a series of steps, each of which leads closer to the final goal.	trajectory	What analogy is used to explain trajectory (machine learning)?
A machine learning trajectory is like a rocket. It starts with a small amount of thrust at first, but as it gains speed and altitude it requires more and more fuel to keep going. Eventually the rocket reaches its peak altitude, and then begins to descend back down to Earth. The same is true for machine learning; the further it progresses, the more data and processing power it requires to continue learning.	trajectory	What analogy is used to explain trajectory (machine learning)?
Machine learning can be thought of as a journey. In the beginning, there is very little data and you must rely on your intuition to make decisions. As you collect more data, your understanding of the problem improves and you are able to make better decisions. With enough data, you can build a model that accurately predicts future outcomes.	trajectory	What analogy is used to explain trajectory (machine learning)?
Machine learning is similar to a ball being thrown into the air. As it goes higher and higher, its velocity slows down until it eventually falls back to Earth.

A transformer analogy is used to explain machine learning. In the transformer analogy, input data (such as pictures of animals) are fed into a computer system, which then "transforms" or processes the data in some way. The transformed data is then analyzed by a machine learning algorithm, which extracts features from the data (e.g., identifying whether an animal is a dog or cat). Finally, these features can be used to predict how likely it is that a new input will be classified in a certain category (e.g., predicting that a new picture is most likely of a dog).	transformer	What analogy is used to explain transformer (machine learning)?
The transformer analogy compares the workings of a transformer to the workings of a machine learning algorithm. The primary purpose of both is to convert energy from one form to another.

A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a function that takes in an image and outputs a probability distribution over the objects in the image.

There is a machine learning analogy that can be used to explain unawareness (to a sensitive attribute). This analogy likens the process of training a machine learning algorithm to the process of training a dog. In both cases, the trainer provides feedback (corrects behavior) in order to help the trainee learn and improve. With dogs, this feedback usually takes the form of praise or treats. With machines, it typically takes the form of adjusting how we weight different inputs when teaching our algorithms.	unawareness (to a sensitive attribute)	What analogy is used to explain unawareness (to a sensitive attribute) (machine learning)?

A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a set of weights between input features and an output, much like the settings on a dial control the strength of an electric current.

The analogy goes like this: if you want to study a population of lions, it would be inefficient to go out into the jungle and try to find and track down every lion. It would be much more efficient to randomly select a small number of lions from the population and observe them. This is what's called sampling; by studying a small representative subset of the data, we can learn about the entire population.	undersampling	What analogy is used to explain undersampling (machine learning)?
It is often said that a good way to understand the workings of machine learning algorithms is by analogy with human brains. One can think of the algorithm as being presented with a small sample (the training data) from which it tries to learn some general rules or patterns. These rules or patterns can then be used to make predictions about other, unseen data (the test data).	undersampling	What analogy is used to explain undersampling (machine learning)?
One analogy is to think of the data as a very large container of water. You want to take a drink but can only scoop out a cup at a time. If you try to take a sip from the entire container, you will not be able to because there is too much volume. However, if you take many sips from different parts of the container, then you will have enough for a drink.	undersampling	What analogy is used to explain undersampling (machine learning)?
Undersampling can be thought of as akin to taking a small sample from a much larger population. Just as with sampling, undersampling allows for the estimation of population characteristics by using data drawn from a subset of the population. Furthermore, because only a limited number of observations are used in this estimation procedure, undersampling tends to produce more accurate estimates than would be possible if the entire population were examined.	undersampling	What analogy is used to explain undersampling (machine learning)?
A common analogy for undersampling is to imagine you are trying to listen to a conversation at a noisy party. If you try to listen from close by, you will likely hear only parts of individual sentences and miss the overall conversation.

The unidirectional analogy can be used to explain machine learning by comparing it to the way in which a computer processes information. Just as a computer follows a specific set of instructions that is provided to it, a machine learning algorithm also follows a pre-determined set of rules or instructions.

It is often said that, in unsupervised learning, the machine “teaches itself.” This analogy may be helpful in understanding what unsupervised learning is and how it works: Imagine you are a young child, and your parents have just given you your first set of crayons. You are probably not going to know what to do with them at first; but if you take a look at the coloring book they gave you, you will start to get some ideas.

The analogy of a person is used to explain how validation works in machine learning. In the example, the person has learned to identify objects by sight. The first time they see an object, they may not be able to identify it. However, after seeing the object multiple times, they learn to associate certain features with that particular object. This process of recognition and identification is similar to what happens when a machine learning algorithm is "trained" on data. Initially, the algorithm may not be very good at identifying objects or predicting outcomes. But through repeated exposure to data (i.e., training), the algorithm becomes better at recognizing patterns and making predictions	validation	What analogy is used to explain validation (machine learning)?
The analogy is that a person's brain can be thought of as a computer, with each neuron in the brain corresponding to a bit of information. When we learn something new, our neurons are firing and connecting together, forming new pathways. As we continue to learn and experience the world, these pathways become stronger and easier to access. Machine learning algorithms work in a similar way; they form connections between data points (represented by neurons) based on how often they occur together. The more data points that are connected, the more confident the algorithm is in its predictions.	validation	What analogy is used to explain validation (machine learning)?

In machine learning, the vanishing gradient problem is a situation where the gradients of successive layers in a neural network become very small, which makes it difficult for the neural network to learn from its training data. This can happen when there are too many hidden layers in the network or when the weight updates in each layer are too small.	vanishing gradient problem	What analogy is used to explain vanishing gradient problem (machine learning)?
The Vanishing Gradient problem is also called the “Plateauing Problem.” It is a phenomenon that can occur in neural networks during training when the gradient of the error function becomes very small, making it difficult for the network to learn new values for its neurons. Imagine trying to walk up a hill with very gradual slopes. You might be able to make some progress initially, but eventually you will reach a point where you stop climbing no matter how much effort you put in. This is similar to what happens with vanishing gradients – once the gradient gets too small, the network can no longer learn new values and therefore fails to improve.	vanishing gradient problem	What analogy is used to explain vanishing gradient problem (machine learning)?
In machine learning, the vanishing gradient problem is a situation in which the optimization algorithm used to train a neural network gradually becomes less effective at finding an accurate solution as the number of layers in the network increase.	vanishing gradient problem	What analogy is used to explain vanishing gradient problem (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain the vanishing gradient problem is that of a staircase. As one walks up a staircase, the distance between each step gets smaller and smaller. This is similar to how the training error for a neural network decreases as it continues learning more examples. However, at some point this decrease in error stops happening and even starts increasing, leading to what is known as the vanishing gradient problem.	vanishing gradient problem	What analogy is used to explain vanishing gradient problem (machine learning)?
A ball thrown off a cliff will continue to move away from the cliff until it reaches its terminal velocity. After this point, the ball's speed remains constant. The gradient of the ball's displacement (speed and direction) with respect to time is constantly diminishing as it gets further from the cliff. This analogy can be used to explain the vanishing gradient problem in machine learning, where the gradients of error functions diminish as training data becomes more sparsely distributed.	vanishing gradient problem	What analogy is used to explain vanishing gradient problem (machine learning)?
A machine learning algorithm can be thought of as a black box. inputs go in, and an answer comes out. The goal is to make the box as small as possible, so that it can be easily transported and used without anyone understanding what’s going on inside.	wasserstein loss	What analogy is used to explain wasserstein loss (machine learning)?
One analogy is that of a teacher who must grade many essays. The first essay is easy to grade, since the teacher has a good sense of what an A, B, C, or D paper looks like. However, as the number of papers increase, grading each one becomes more difficult because the teacher can no longer rely on personal experience to determine how to grade them. This same phenomenon occurs in machine learning when models are trained on datasets with many instances (e.g., images). As more data is fed into the model, it becomes harder and harder for the model to learn from this data effectively due to “overfitting” – that is, the model begins to memorize specific details in the training dataset rather than generalizing from this data to correctly classify new instances.	wasserstein loss	What analogy is used to explain wasserstein loss (machine learning)?
The analogy is that of two identical buckets, one filled with regular water and the other with salt water. Over time, the bucket of regular water will evaporate more quickly because it has a lower evaporation rate than the bucket of salt water.	wasserstein loss	What analogy is used to explain wasserstein loss (machine learning)?

The analogy of weight is using a machine learning Predictor as a scale. In order to "weigh" an object, one would need to put it on the scale and see how the scale moves in response. The more data that is fed into the predictor (the more objects placed on the scale), the more accurate its predictions will be about future objects' weights.	weight	What analogy is used to explain weight (machine learning)?
The analogy of weight is used to explain the working principle of machine learning. In general, the more data you feed a machine learning algorithm, the better it becomes at recognizing patterns in that data and making predictions. This is analogous to adding weights to one side of a scale causes it to tip in that direction. Similarly, as you add more data to a machine learning algorithm, its ability to predict outcomes accurately increases.	weight	What analogy is used to explain weight (machine learning)?
One analogy to explain weight is that of learning a new language. When you first start learning a new language, the task may seem daunting and difficult. However, as you continue to learn more and more of the language, the task gradually becomes easier until it eventually feels effortless. The same concept applies to weight in machine learning; by increasing your understanding and knowledge of how machine learning works, the weight (or difficulty) associated with implementing it will gradually lessen.	weight	What analogy is used to explain weight (machine learning)?
Machine learning is often explained with the analogy of a person's brain. The human brain can learn and make predictions by analyzing data, just as machine learning algorithms do.	weight	What analogy is used to explain weight (machine learning)?
Analogy: Weight (machine learning) is like a box of rocks. The more rocks you have in the box, the heavier it gets.	weight	What analogy is used to explain weight (machine learning)?
Wals is a machine learning technique similar to gradient descent, but it uses a weighted average of past gradients instead of a single one. This makes the algorithm more stable and less likely to get stuck in local minima.	weighted alternating least squares (wals)	What analogy is used to explain weighted alternating least squares (wals) (machine learning)?
It is often helpful to think of WALS as a variation of the gradient descent optimization algorithm. Like gradient descent, WALS iteratively adjusts weights in order to minimize some measure of error (in this case, the squared error). However, unlike gradient descent, which uses only a single weight adjustment at each step, WALS uses a weighted average of multiple adjustments. This weighted average helps to smooth out the errors and avoids getting stuck in local minima	weighted alternating least squares (wals)	What analogy is used to explain weighted alternating least squares (wals) (machine learning)?
The analogy of weighted alternating least squares is that it is like you are trying to fit a jigsaw puzzle together. You have some pieces that are all the same shape, size and color. Then you have other pieces that are different shapes, sizes and colors. The goal is to try to fit as many of the same shaped, sized and colored pieces together as possible. Once those are all fitted together, then you can start fitting the other pieces together.	weighted alternating least squares (wals)	What analogy is used to explain weighted alternating least squares (wals) (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain weighted alternating least squares (wals) is that it is similar to the process of mixing different colors of paint together. The more blue paint you add to a mixture, the bluer the mixture will be. However, if you add too much blue paint, the mixture will become navy blue and won't be very light anymore. In contrast, adding white paint will make the mixture lighter even if there isn't much white paint added. Weighted alternating least squares uses this same idea; by giving different weights to each training example, we can tell our algorithm how important each example is in regards to minimizing the error on our test set.	weighted alternating least squares (wals)	What analogy is used to explain weighted alternating least squares (wals) (machine learning)?
An analogy used to explain weighted alternating least squares (wals) is that it is like a teacher grading homework. The teacher will give more weight to the homework assignments that are more important, and less weight to the homework assignments that are less important.	weighted alternating least squares (wals)	What analogy is used to explain weighted alternating least squares (wals) (machine learning)?
A wide model is like a big net that can capture lots of different types of fish. A deep model is like a spear that can only catch one type of fish.	wide model	What analogy is used to explain wide model (machine learning)?
The analogy of wide model is that it is like a sponge. Wide models can absorb more data and learn from it, which makes them better at recognizing patterns and making predictions.	wide model	What analogy is used to explain wide model (machine learning)?
The machine learning analogy is that the wide model is like a big net that catches more fish than the narrow model. The wide model can learn more complex patterns because it has more data to work with.	wide model	What analogy is used to explain wide model (machine learning)?
A model is like a car. You can use it to drive from point A to point B.	wide model	What analogy is used to explain wide model (machine learning)?
A model is like a miniature (simplified) representation of the real world. A wide model can be thought of as having a lot of little models inside it, each representing a tiny slice of the real world.	wide model	What analogy is used to explain wide model (machine learning)?
Width is a measure of how spread out the points in a set are. It can be thought of as the distance from the center of the set to the outermost point.	width	What analogy is used to explain width (machine learning)?
Width is explained in machine learning as the number of neurons in a layer.	width	What analogy is used to explain width (machine learning)?
Width can be explained with the analogy of a conveyor belt. The width of the belt is how much data can be processed at one time.	width	What analogy is used to explain width (machine learning)?
Width is used in machine learning as a metaphor to explain the number of examples that are used to train a machine learning algorithm. Just as a car needs more width (or distance) to make a sharp turn, so too does a machine learning algorithm need more data points in order to accurately learn from them.	width	What analogy is used to explain width (machine learning)?
Width is analogous to the number of data points in a machine learning training set. The wider the set, the more confident an algorithm can be in its predictions.	width	What analogy is used to explain width (machine learning)?
The analogy used to explain word embedding is that it is like giving every word in the English language its own GPS coordinate. This way, when you want to find out the meaning of a word, you can just plug in its coordinate and get information about all of the words around it.	word embedding	What analogy is used to explain word embedding (machine learning)?
One analogy for word embedding is that it’s like giving each word in a sentence its own unique address. So, if you wanted to go and visit the word “cat,” you would first have to know its address, which would be something like “word-embedding-machine-learning/cat.”	word embedding	What analogy is used to explain word embedding (machine learning)?
A word embedding (machine learning) is similar to a compressed file. The more information that is put into the compressed file, the more accurate it becomes at recreating the original data. In the same way, by using many different training examples, a word embedding can learn to predict how words are related to one another with great accuracy.	word embedding	What analogy is used to explain word embedding (machine learning)?
A good analogy for word embedding is the use of coordinates to describe locations on a map. Just as each location on a map can be accurately described by its latitude and longitude, so too can each word in a text be accurately described by its corresponding vector in space.	word embedding	What analogy is used to explain word embedding (machine learning)?
An analogy to explain word embedding is that it is similar to the relationship between objects in the real world and their corresponding words. Just as there are many different shapes and sizes of physical objects, there are also many different meanings for words. However, when two physical objects share certain characteristics (such as color), we can group them together using a single word (e.g., "green" apples). The same concept applies to word embeddings: just as two physical objects can be grouped together based on their shared characteristics, so too can two words be clustered together based on their similarities in meaning.	word embedding	What analogy is used to explain word embedding (machine learning)?
