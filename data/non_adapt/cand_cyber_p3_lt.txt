Supply chain risk management (cybersecurity) is like a fence around a property. It is there to protect the property from being damaged or stolen. The fence is not there to keep people out, but to keep people and things in. The same is true for supply chain risk management (cybersecurity). It is there to protect the supply chain from being damaged or stolen. The supply chain is not there to keep people out, but to keep people and things in.	supply chain risk management	Using an analogy, explain supply chain risk management (cybersecurity).
If you think of symmetric cryptography as a locked room, then the key is the only way to get in. Once someone is in, they can let others in without having to use the key again.

If the system is not secure, the data will not be secure.	system integrity	Using an analogy, explain system integrity (cybersecurity).
Systems development can be thought of as the construction of a house. The first step is to plan the house, including what materials will be used and where each room will be located. The second step is to build the foundation, which will support the weight of the house. The third step is to erect the frame, which will hold the walls and roof.

They may also order tests to help diagnose the problem.	systems security analysis	Using an analogy, explain systems security analysis (cybersecurity).
A system's security architecture is like the foundation of a house. It is the underlying structure that supports everything else and must be strong in order to keep the house standing. The security architecture must be able to protect the system from attacks and unauthorized access, while also allowing authorized users to access the system safely. It is also important that the security architecture be scalable so that it can grow and adapt as the system evolves.	systems security architecture	Using an analogy, explain systems security architecture (cybersecurity).
A tabletop exercise is a simulation of a cyber incident that allows organizations to test their response plans and procedures. The exercise is conducted in a conference room or other meeting space with representatives from all key areas of the organization. The scenario is typically a cyberattack that has already occurred and the goal is to assess the organization's response.	tabletop exercise	Using an analogy, explain tabletop exercise (cybersecurity).
A tailored trustworthy space is like a suit that has been specifically made for you. It fits you perfectly and makes you look and feel great. The suit has been made with your measurements and with the best materials available. It has been tailored to your specific needs and preferences.In the same way, a tailored trustworthy space is a cybersecurity solution that has been specifically designed for your organization. It is based on your specific needs and preferences, and it has been created with the best materials available. The solution is tailored to your specific requirements and it provides you with the protection you need.	tailored trustworthy space	Using an analogy, explain tailored trustworthy space (cybersecurity).
A target in cybersecurity is an entity, such as a computer or a network, that is the focus of an attack. The attacker's goal is to exploit the target's vulnerabilities in order to gain access to its resources or to damage its operations.	targets	Using an analogy, explain targets (cybersecurity).
Technology research and development can be thought of as the process of creating new technology or improving upon existing technology. Cybersecurity research and development can be thought of as the process of creating new cybersecurity technology or improving upon existing cybersecurity technology.	technology research and development	Using an analogy, explain technology research and development (cybersecurity).
Testing and evaluation (T&E) is like a carpenter using a hammer and nails to build a house. The carpenter uses the hammer to drive the nails into the wood, and the nails hold the wood together. In the same way, T&E uses tools (e.g., penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and security assessment) to test the security of a system and identify vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are then fixed, and the system is retested to ensure that the vulnerabilities have been fixed.	test and evaluation	Using an analogy, explain test and evaluation (cybersecurity).

This protocol allows administrators to quickly and easily assess the security of a network.	traffic light protocol	Using an analogy, explain traffic light protocol (cybersecurity).
A trojan horse is a type of malware that is disguised as a legitimate program or file. When users install the trojan horse, they inadvertently give the malware access to their computer. The trojan horse can then be used to steal information or damage the computer.	trojan horse	Using an analogy, explain trojan horse (cybersecurity).
Unauthorized access can be best explained using an analogy. Imagine that you are a homeowner and you have a lock on your door. You give a key to your friend so that they can come and visit you any time they want. However, if someone else gets their hands on your friend's key, they will be able to come into your house without your permission. This is essentially what unauthorized access is - someone gaining access to a system or network without permission.	unauthorized access	Using an analogy, explain unauthorized access (cybersecurity).
A virus is a small piece of software that can copy itself and spread from one computer to another. It can cause a lot of damage, like deleting files or crashing the computer. Cybersecurity is like a vaccine for your computer. It's a program that helps protect your computer from viruses and other online threats.	virus	Using an analogy, explain virus (cybersecurity).
If you think of your computer as a house, your firewall as a security guard, and your antivirus software as a watchdog, then vulnerability would be the fact that your house has only one security guard and no watchdog. In other words, your computer is not as secure as it could be, because it is not protected by a firewall and an antivirus program.	vulnerability	Using an analogy, explain vulnerability (cybersecurity).
Just as a homeowner would assess their home for vulnerabilities and take steps to mitigate them, a business would do the same for their computer systems and networks. This includes identifying potential weaknesses (e.g. weak passwords, unpatched software) and taking steps to fix them. Vulnerability management is an ongoing process, as new vulnerabilities are discovered all the time.	vulnerability assessment and management	Using an analogy, explain vulnerability assessment and management (cybersecurity).
Weakness in cybersecurity can be likened to a hole in a dam. Just as water can flow through the hole and cause damage, cybercriminals can exploit vulnerabilities in cybersecurity to steal data or damage systems.	weakness	Using an analogy, explain weakness (cybersecurity).
A white team is a group of people who are brought together to test the security of a system. The team is typically composed of experts in various areas of security, including penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and cryptography. The goal of the white team is to identify vulnerabilities in the system and recommend ways to fix them.	white team	Using an analogy, explain white team (cybersecurity).
Work factor is the amount of time and effort it would take for an attacker to break into a system. The higher the work factor, the more secure the system is.	work factor	Using an analogy, explain work factor (cybersecurity).
A worm is a type of malware that is designed to spread from computer to computer. It can do this by exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system or by using social engineering techniques to trick users into opening infected files or clicking on malicious links. Once a worm is installed on a computer, it can do a variety of things, such as stealing information, installing ransomware, or using the computer to launch attacks against other systems.	worm	Using an analogy, explain worm (cybersecurity).
