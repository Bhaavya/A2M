It is made from high-quality materials, is tailored to your specific needs, and is designed to keep you safe and secure.	tailored trustworthy space	Use an analogy to explain tailored trustworthy space (cybersecurity).
A target in cybersecurity is like a bullseye on a dartboard. Attackers aim for these targets because they know that they are vulnerable and can be exploited. Organizations need to protect their targets by implementing security measures to make them less vulnerable to attack.	targets	Use an analogy to explain targets (cybersecurity).
Cybersecurity research and development can be thought of as akin to the development of new vaccines. Just as new vaccines are developed to protect people from new and emerging diseases, new cybersecurity technologies are developed to protect people from new and emerging cyber threats. Just as it is important to continue to develop new vaccines to protect people from new diseases, it is important to continue to develop new cybersecurity technologies to protect people from new cyber threats.	technology research and development	Use an analogy to explain technology research and development (cybersecurity).
Testing and evaluation can be thought of as a car. The car has many parts, and each part needs to be tested to make sure it works properly and will function as intended. The same is true for cybersecurity. Each part of the cybersecurity system needs to be tested to make sure it works properly and will function as intended.	test and evaluation	Use an analogy to explain test and evaluation (cybersecurity).
Threat is like a robber who is trying to break into your house to steal your belongings.	threat	Use an analogy to explain threat (cybersecurity).
A threat actor is like a robber who breaks into a house to steal things. The robber is the threat actor, and the house is the computer. The things that the robber steals are the data that the hacker steals.	threat actor	Use an analogy to explain threat actor (cybersecurity).
A threat agent is like a virus. It is a small, but potentially deadly, piece of code that can infect and damage a computer system.	threat agent	Use an analogy to explain threat agent (cybersecurity).
Threat analysis is like a security guard at a bank. The security guard is looking for people who may be trying to rob the bank. They are looking for anything that may be out of the ordinary. They are also looking for people who may be trying to hack into the bank's computer system.	threat analysis	Use an analogy to explain threat analysis (cybersecurity).
Threat assessment is like a security guard at a bank. The security guard is looking for people who may be trying to rob the bank. They are looking for people who may be acting suspicious or who may have a weapon. They are also looking for people who may have a history of robbing banks.	threat assessment	Use an analogy to explain threat assessment (cybersecurity).
A ticket is like a key that unlocks a door. The ticket is like a password that is needed to access a computer or network.	ticket	Use an analogy to explain ticket (cybersecurity).
A traffic light protocol is a cybersecurity measure that uses a traffic light metaphor to control the flow of traffic between two or more systems. The protocol uses three colors to represent the level of trust between systems: green for safe, yellow for caution, and red for stop. Data can only flow between systems when the traffic light is green, and the systems can only communicate with each other when the traffic light is green. If the traffic light turns yellow, the systems must stop communicating with each other until the traffic light turns green again. If the traffic light turns red, the systems must not communicate with each other at all.	traffic light protocol	Use an analogy to explain traffic light protocol (cybersecurity).
A trojan horse is a type of malware that is disguised as a legitimate program or file. When you open the file, the malware is installed on your computer.	trojan horse	Use an analogy to explain trojan horse (cybersecurity).
Unauthorized access is like someone breaking into your house. They may not have permission to be there, and they may not have the right to see or take what they want.	unauthorized access	Use an analogy to explain unauthorized access (cybersecurity).
A virus is like a cold or the flu. It is a small, self-replicating program that can attach to other programs and files, making them unusable. It can also spread to other computers. Just like a cold or the flu, a virus can make you sick and can be difficult to get rid of.	virus	Use an analogy to explain virus (cybersecurity).
A vulnerability in cybersecurity is like a hole in a dam. If the hole is not fixed, the water will continue to flow through it and eventually the dam will break.	vulnerability	Use an analogy to explain vulnerability (cybersecurity).
A vulnerability assessment and management (cybersecurity) is like a doctor examining a patient for potential health risks. The doctor looks for any red flags that could indicate a problem, and then develops a plan to address any issues that are identified. Similarly, a vulnerability assessment and management (cybersecurity) program identifies potential security risks and develops a plan to address them.	vulnerability assessment and management	Use an analogy to explain vulnerability assessment and management (cybersecurity).
Weakness in cybersecurity can be analogized to a door that is not locked. If an intruder can easily enter through an unsecured door, the intruder can access the entire house, including any valuable possessions inside. Similarly, if a hacker can easily access an organization's computer systems through a weak cybersecurity system, the hacker can access any confidential information or valuable data stored on the systems.	weakness	Use an analogy to explain weakness (cybersecurity).
