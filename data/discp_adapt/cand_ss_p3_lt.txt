Ribosomes are like the machines that put together the pieces of a car. The car has a lot of different parts, and the machines put the parts together in the right order. The ribosomes do the same thing with the proteins.	ribosome	Explain ribosome using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for a social science student.
An activator protein is like a key that unlocks a door. The activator protein binds to a specific site on the DNA molecule and then activates the transcription of that gene.	activator protein	Explain activator protein using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for a social science student.
Electricity is like water in a hose. The water pressure (voltage) is like the water pressure in the hose. The amount of water flowing through the hose (amperage) is like the amount of electricity flowing through the circuit. The length of the hose (length of wire) is like the length of the wire in the circuit. The diameter of the hose (cross-sectional area of wire) is like the cross-sectional area of the wire in the circuit.	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for a social science student.
The hydrophobic effect is similar to the way that oil and water do not mix. The hydrophobic effect is the tendency of molecules to be repelled from water. This is because water is polar and molecules that are hydrophobic are nonpolar.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for a social science student.
Biological signal transduction can be thought of as a telephone system. The telephone system converts sound waves into electrical signals that can be transmitted over a telephone line. The electrical signals are then converted back into sound waves at the other end of the telephone line. Biological signal transduction works in a similar way. The difference is that the signals are converted into chemical signals that can be transmitted through the cell membrane.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for a social science student.
