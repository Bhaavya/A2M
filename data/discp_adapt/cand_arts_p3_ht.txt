Cells are the building blocks of life. Just as an artist might use a variety of colors to create a painting, cells use different molecules to create functional proteins and structures. Some cells specialize in certain tasks, just as an artist might focus on painting portraits or landscapes.	cells	Explain cells using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Cells are like the pixels on a computer screen. Just as each pixel can be individually controlled to create an image, each cell in your body can be individually controlled to carry out its specific function.	cells	Explain cells using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.

Think of the cell membrane as a brick wall. The bricks are the cells and the mortar is the cell membrane.

The Golgi body can be thought of as the postal service of the cell. It takes letters (proteins) from one part of the cell and delivers them to other parts.	golgi body	Explain golgi body using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
A golgi body is a bit like an artist's workshop. The artist might start by sketching out a rough idea of what they want to create on a piece of paper. Next, the artist would use different coloured paints and brushes to create a more detailed picture. Finally, they might add some finishing touches like glitter or gold leaf. In the same way, the golgi body takes proteins that have been created in the ribosomes and processes them into new molecules that can be used by the cell. It also adds labels to these molecules so that they can be identified and shipped off to where they're needed.	golgi body	Explain golgi body using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
The golgi body can be likened to an office worker who receives a stack of papers from the secretary, reads them, and then distributes them to the appropriate people in the office. The golgi body receives proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum, modifies them, and sends them off to their final destination.	golgi body	Explain golgi body using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Think of capacitance as a container for holding energy. Just like you can store water in a bucket or a bathtub, you can store electricity in a capacitor. The more water (or electricity) you have, the higher the capacitance.	capacitance	Explain capacitance using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
A capacitor is like a water tank. It can hold a certain amount of water (charge) and it takes time to fill up the tank (charging). Once the tank is full, it can't hold anymore water no matter how much you try (discharging).	capacitance	Explain capacitance using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
A capacitor is like a container of water. If you have two containers of water, one with a small hole in the bottom and one without a hole, which container will hold more water? The container with the smaller hole will hold more water. This is because the water can flow into and out of the container easier through the smaller hole. A capacitor is similar because it has two plates (electrodes) with an electric field between them. The electric field creates an area where electrons can't move freely, so it's like having a small hole in the top of the container. This limits how many electrons can flow in and out of the capacitor at any given time, and this is what causes capacitance to increase.	capacitance	Explain capacitance using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Electric current can be thought of as flowing water. Just like water flows downhill and from high to low pressure, electric current flows from high voltage to low voltage.

The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Electric current is like a river of electricity. Just as a river flows downhill, electric current flows from the higher voltage to the lower voltage. The width (amperage) of the river corresponds to the amount of electricity flowing through it at any given moment.	electric current	Explain electric current using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Electric current is like a flow of water. Just as water flows downhill, electric current flows from high voltage to low voltage.

A cell is like a small city. The cells in your body are specialized to do different things- some make energy, some fight infection, and others help you think. Just like people in a city have different jobs, the cells in your body have specific functions that they perform. Cells communicate with each other using chemical signals to coordinate their activities.	specialization and communication in a cell	Explain specialization and communication in a cell using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
A cell is like a theatre production. The different specializations within the cell (e.g., actors, directors, set designers) communicate with each other to create a unified performance. The director tells the actors what to do and how to do it, while the set designer creates the scenery and decides where everything goes. Meanwhile, the lighting technician makes sure that everything looks good on stage. Each person's role is important for putting on a successful show.	specialization and communication in a cell	Explain specialization and communication in a cell using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
One way to think of the specialization and communication within cells is to imagine an art studio. In this analogy, the cell is the artist, and specialized parts of the cell are like different tools that the artist might use while creating a work of art. Just as an artist needs to be able to communicate with other people in order to get their ideas across, cells need to be able to communicate with one another in order for all of the cells' functions to work together properly.	specialization and communication in a cell	Explain specialization and communication in a cell using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Imagine you are at a party. There are lots of people and they are all talking loudly. You can't hear anyone properly, so you walk around the room to get closer to them. As you move closer, you can hear them better. The same principle applies to electricity - as voltage (the pressure of the electricity) increases, it becomes easier for electrons (the tiny particles that carry electricity) to flow through a circuit, allowing more current (the amount of electrical charge passing through a point in a given time) to flow.	kirchoff's voltage law	Explain kirchoff's voltage law using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Kirchoff's voltage law can be explained using an analogy involving a group of people. Imagine that you are standing in the middle of a large group of people. If you want to know which way is north, you can look at the direction that most people are facing. In the same way, if you want to find out which way is positive voltage, you can look at the direction that most electrons are flowing.	kirchoff's voltage law	Explain kirchoff's voltage law using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
An analogy for Kirchoff's Voltage Law is a group of people standing in a circle. The person in the middle has a bunch of balloons.

The human active memory system is like a library. The library has many different rooms, and each room is filled with different books. To find a specific book, you have to know which room it is in, and then you have to know which shelf it is on. The same thing is true for memories: You have to know where they are stored in your brain, and you have to know what path you need to take to get there.	human active memory system	Explain human active memory system using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
The human active memory system can be likened to a library. The library contains all of the books that have been published, and it is constantly being updated as new books are added.

The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
The rate-determining step of a reaction is the slowest step. This analogy would be like someone trying to run across a field while being chased by a bear. The person is running as fast as they can, but the bear is slowly catching up to them. The bear is the rate-determining step.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Explain rate-determining step of a reaction using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
One way to think about the rate-determining step of a reaction is as if it's the "key" that unlocks the rest of the reaction. Just like when you're trying to open a door, you need to use the right key (the keyhole is shaped specifically for that key), in order for the door to unlock, each step in a chemical reaction must have its own specific "key." The rate-determining step is then the key that takes longest to swing into place and start unlocking everything else.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Explain rate-determining step of a reaction using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Column chromatography is like sorting through a pile of mixed up colored pencils to find the green one. The artist first separates all of the colors into piles and then starts looking through each pile for the green one. Column chromatography does the same thing with molecules; it separates them into different groups based on their size and chemical properties.	column chromatography	Explain column chromatography using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Column chromatography is like a high-school dance. The different 'classes' of people (chemicals) are lined up at one end of the room and as the music plays, they walk down the line towards the other end. At the other end, there are different 'clubs' (the different compounds that you're trying to separate). As each person reaches the club they want to go to, they start dancing. When it's time for them to leave, they say goodbye and head back to their original spot in line.	column chromatography	Explain column chromatography using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Column chromatography is a bit like separating paint colours in an art class. You have a jar of coloured paints and you want to divide them into several smaller containers. To do this, you pour some of the paint into a small container and then mix it around with a brush. You keep doing this until all the paint is in the small container. Then you repeat the process with each of the other colours. This is basically what column chromatography does – it separates different substances by size and weight	column chromatography	Explain column chromatography using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Dynamic chemical equilibrium is a bit like a dance party. Just as people are constantly moving around the room, atoms and molecules are constantly moving around in chemical reactions. However, at any given time, most of the people in the room are just standing there, not dancing. Likewise, most of the atoms and molecules in a chemical reaction are not participating in the reaction; they're just sitting there waiting for their turn to get involved. When you have a lot of people at a party who aren't dancing, it's hard to tell what's going on (just like when you have a lot of inactive atoms and molecules in a chemical reaction). But if you look closely enough, you can see that everyone is still moving around even though they're not all doing the same thing.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Explain dynamic chemical equilibrium using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Dynamic chemical equilibrium can be compared to a group of people in a room. Each person is talking and shouting over the others, creating a lot of noise. However, as time goes on, people will start to quiet down until eventually there is only one or two people speaking. This represents dynamic chemical equilibrium because the molecules are constantly interacting with each other until they eventually reach equilibrium.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Explain dynamic chemical equilibrium using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.

The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Imagine that you are a musician and need to transport your music equipment from one place to another. You could carry all of your equipment in your arms, but it would be very heavy and difficult to move around. A better solution would be to put all of your equipment into a large bag or case. This way, you can easily carry the equipment with you wherever you go. Transport vesicles work in a similar way. They are small bags that hold molecules or proteins which need to be transported from one part of the cell to another.	transport vesicles	Explain transport vesicles using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Can you think of a way to explain transport vesicles using an analogy?Here's one possible analogy: Transport vesicles are like tiny cargo ships that carry important materials (like proteins) from one part of the cell to another. The cells use these tiny cargo ships to make sure that the right materials end up in the right place at the right time.	transport vesicles	Explain transport vesicles using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.

The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Proto-oncogenes can be thought of as musical instruments. Just like an instrument needs to be played in the right way by a musician, proto-oncogenes need to be "played" by proteins called tumor suppressors in order to keep cells healthy. When they are not playing their usual role, proto-oncogenes can become cancerous.	proto-oncogenes	Explain proto-oncogenes using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Proto-oncogenes are like the blueprints for a house. They tell the cells how to grow and divide, and they also help to keep the cells healthy. Sometimes, something goes wrong with the proto-oncogenes and they start telling the cells to grow out of control. This is what leads to cancer.	proto-oncogenes	Explain proto-oncogenes using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
A cancer-causing gene can be thought of as a kind of like a virus.

One way to think of tumor suppressor genes is as brakes on the cell cycle. Just as a car needs brakes to keep it from speeding out of control, cells need tumor suppressor genes to keep them from dividing too rapidly and becoming cancerous.	tumor suppressor genes	Explain tumor suppressor genes using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
If you were to break a piece of brittle software, it would be very easy to do. The software might snap into two pieces with just a little pressure, and once it's broken, it's likely that the pieces won't fit back together again. This is because brittle software is not well-made; it doesn't have much flexibility or resilience. In other words, it's easy to damage and difficult to fix.	brittle software	Explain brittle software using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
If you've ever tried to make a paper snowflake, you know that the end result is always delicate and fragile. You can't just crumple it up into a ball and expect it to look the same as when you started.

When all of the notes are played together, they create a beautiful chord or resonance.	resonance hybrid	Explain resonance hybrid using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Resonance hybrid is a bit like when an opera singer sings loudly and hits a high note - all of the sound waves in the room start to vibrate at the same frequency as the opera singer's voice. This creates a really loud noise that can be heard throughout the whole room. In much the same way, resonance hybrid occurs when all of the electrons in an atom or molecule start to vibrate at the same frequency. This makes it possible for them to share energy more easily and create a really strong force between them.	resonance hybrid	Explain resonance hybrid using an analogy.

The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
The analogy of an EEG is like a group of people chatting in a room. If one person starts talking louder, the rest of the group will pick up on this and start speaking louder as well.

The ecosystem can be thought of as an interconnected group of artists, each with their own unique talents and styles. Just as in nature, where different species of animals work together to create a balanced and thriving environment, the artists in this analogy must cooperate and collaborate in order to create something beautiful and meaningful.	ecosystem	Explain ecosystem using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
The ecosystem can be thought of as a huge, elaborate machine. The sun is the engine that powers the machine, and all of the creatures within it are its parts. The plants are the filters that clean the air, and the animals are the recyclers who eat the plants and then poop out their waste products so that new plants can grow.

The propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to the way in which a message is transmitted through a telephone line. When you make a phone call, your voice travels down the telephone line as an electrical signal. This signal is picked up by the earpiece of the person you are calling and turned back into sound waves that they can hear. The action potentials travelling down the neuron work in a very similar way - they create an electrical current that passes from one end of the neuron to the other.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
When you clap your hands, the energy travels from your hands, up your arms and through your body until it reaches your brain. This is similar to how an action potential travels down a neuron. The action potential starts at the synapse and travels down the axon to the end of the neuron.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron using an analogy.

An action potential is like a wave of energy that travels down a neuron. It can be thought of as an energy pulse that starts at the neuron's "head" and moves down its length. This wave of energy triggers molecules called neurotransmitters to release chemicals into the gap between neurons (the synapse). These neurotransmitters cross the synapse and attach to receptor sites on the next neuron, starting another action potential.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.

Anti-stokes scattering is a little like the sound of clapping. When you clap your hands, the sound waves spread out in all directions. Some of these waves will hit your ears and be heard as sound. Other waves will travel off into the distance and eventually disappear. The same thing happens with light: when it's emitted from a source, some of the light travels in every direction. Some of this light will reach our eyes and we'll see it as illumination. Other light will go off into the distance and eventually fade away.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain anti-stokes scattering using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
One possible analogy for how anti-stokes scattering works is to imagine a room full of bouncing balls. If someone stands in the middle of the room and starts bouncing a ball off the floor, then other balls in the room will start bouncing too. This is because the energy from the first ball is causing all of the other balls to bounce around as well. However, if someone were to stand in the middle of the room and start catching balls, then eventually all of the other balls would stop bouncing. This is because once all of the energy has been absorbed by catching balls, there is no longer any energy left to cause them to bounce around. In much the same way, when light encounters an atom that has been excited by absorbing energy (the person standing in the middle of the room), it can cause neighboring atoms to become excited and start emitting light themselves (the other nearby balls). However, if all of those neighboring atoms have already been excited (by absorbing energy from another source), then they will not be able to emit any more light themselves and will instead simply absorb any incoming light (catching balls).	anti-stokes scattering	Explain anti-stokes scattering using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
The scattering of light is similar to the scattering of sand particles in water. When the sun shines on the water, some of the light is reflected off the surface and some is scattered by the sand particles.

The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Stokes scattering is a bit like light being scattered by colourful stained glass windows in a church. The different colours of the glass cause light to be scattered in many directions, and this creates the beautiful effect that we see inside churches.

The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Stokes scattering is a bit like how sunlight reflects off of water. Just as the light bounces off of the surface of the water, the photons in a beam of light will scatter when they hit a particle.

The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
One way to think about the process of light scattering is to imagine a group of people in a room, all talking at once. As you move around the room, you hear different snippets of conversation as different individuals speak directly into your ear. In much the same way, when light passes through a medium like air or water, it scatters off of tiny particles (like molecules) in all directions. This scattered light can reach our eyes from many different angles, which is why the sky looks so bright and blue most of the time.	stokes scattering	Explain stokes scattering using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
The median lethal dose is the amount of a toxin necessary to kill half of the members of a tested population. It can be thought of as the poison's "sweet spot" - it's not too weak, and it's not too strong. To use an analogy, imagine that the median lethal dose is the perfect dosage of arsenic to put in someone's tea. If you put in too little, they might not get sick at all. But if you put in too much, they might die instantly. The median lethal dose is just right - it'll make most people feel sick, but won't cause any fatalities.	median lethal dose	Explain median lethal dose using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
The median lethal dose is the amount of a substance that, when ingested, will kill 50% of those exposed to it. This can be thought of as taking a group of people and splitting them in half - the ones who survive ingesting the substance are on one side, and the ones who die are on the other. The median lethal dose is then the dosage at which exactly half of this hypothetical group dies.	median lethal dose	Explain median lethal dose using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
A median lethal dose is the amount of a drug, toxin or other substance required to kill half of a population of test animals in a specific time period. In other words, it's the point at which 50% of the animals die from exposure to the substance. You could think about it as being like hitting someone with a hammer. A lot of people can take one blow and be fine, but if you hit someone in just the right spot, they'll die instantly. It's kind of the same with drugs or toxins - some people can tolerate quite a bit before they start feeling sick, while others might only need a tiny bit before they're in trouble.	median lethal dose	Explain median lethal dose using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.

Everyone at the party can choose what they want to eat, and then the organizers can see how popular each type of food is by counting how many people ate it.	anova	Explain anova using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
An anova is similar to a critic reviewing a play. The critic looks at all the aspects of the play and judges how well it was done. The anova does the same thing with data, by looking at all the different factors and seeing which ones have an impact on the results.	anova	Explain anova using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
The analogy between anova and art is that they are both ways to measure the quality of a piece of work. Anova is used to measure the quality of a piece of writing, while art is used to measure the quality of a painting or sculpture.	anova	Explain anova using an analogy.

A thermostat is like a conductor in an orchestra. Just as the conductor sets the pace and tone for the musicians, a thermostat controls the temperature of a room.	thermostat	Explain thermostat using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
A thermostat is like a conductor in an orchestra. The conductor tells the musicians when to start and stop playing, and they follow his or her lead. The thermostat controls the temperature in your house by telling the furnace when to turn on and off.	thermostat	Explain thermostat using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Chemical equilibrium is a lot like musical harmony. Just as different notes played together can create a pleasing sound, different molecules in equilibrium work together to create a stable system. Like musicians who must carefully tune their instruments before playing, chemists must carefully adjust the concentrations of chemicals in order to maintain equilibrium.	chemical equilibrium	Explain chemical equilibrium using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Chemical equilibrium is like a symphony orchestra. The different instruments (chemical species) are in balance, and the music they create is beautiful and harmonious.	chemical equilibrium	Explain chemical equilibrium using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Chemical equilibrium is like a balance scale. On one side of the scale, we have reactants (things that are used to make a new substance). On the other side of the scale, we have products (the new substance that is made from the reactants). The scale is in balance when there is no net change in either direction.	chemical equilibrium	Explain chemical equilibrium using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Just-in-time is like having a personal assistant who helps you get everything done just in time for your deadline.	just-in-time	Explain just-in-time using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.

Adaptive immunity can be thought of as an immune system that "learns" and gets better at fighting infections over time. Just like a person can get better at playing the violin by practicing, the adaptive immune system can improve its ability to fight infections by learning from past experiences.	adaptive immunity	Explain adaptive immunity using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Adaptive immunity can be thought of as an immune system that is constantly learning and evolving. It works by “remembering” past infections, and then responding more quickly the next time it encounters that same infection. This analogy might be helpful: think of adaptive immunity as a top student who is always studying and getting better grades than her classmates. She knows all the material inside and out, so when she takes a test, she does really well. Her classmates may have studied just as hard, but they don’t have the same level of knowledge or experience, so they don’t do as well on the test.	adaptive immunity	Explain adaptive immunity using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
The immune system can be thought of as a group of soldiers who are always on guard, ready to protect the body from invaders. This protection is known as immunity. The immune system is adaptive because it can adapt and learn how to fight new infections. It does this by creating memory cells that remember how to attack the infection if it comes back.	adaptive immunity	Explain adaptive immunity using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
If you have a lightbulb and some wires, you can connect the wires to the lightbulb to make it turn on. The electricity flowing through the wires makes the lightbulb turn on. You can think of the electricity as water, and the wires as pipes. The amount of water (or electricity) that flows through a pipe (or wire) is called its flow rate, and is measured in gallons per minute (GPM) or cubic feet per second (CFS). The pressure of the water (or electricity) is called its head, and is measured in pounds per square inch gauge (PSIG), or atmospheres absolute (ATA). Ohm's law says that the voltage across a resistor is proportional to the current flowing through it. In other words, if you increase the voltage across a resistor, you will also increase the current flowing through it.	ohm's law	Explain ohm's law using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
One analogy for Ohm's law is that of a water hose. The diameter of the hose (the resistance) determines how much water pressure you'll get at the end (voltage). The length of the hose also affects the pressure (current), because it takes longer for the water to flow down a long hose than a short one.	ohm's law	Explain ohm's law using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
The flow of water through a hose is analogous to the flow of electricity through a wire. Just as the diameter of the hose affects how much water flows through it, so too does the diameter of a wire affect how much electricity flows through it. The pressure of the water (in pounds per square inch) is analogous to the voltage of electricity. And just as more gallons of water will flow if you increase the pressure at the faucet, so too will more amps of electricity flow if you increase the voltage	ohm's law	Explain ohm's law using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Transcription is the process of copying a text from one medium to another. It is very similar to copying a drawing from one piece of paper to another - you need to be precise and pay attention to all of the details in order to create an accurate replica.	transcription	Explain transcription using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Transcription is like taking a picture of a painting. The transcriptionist looks at the painting and tries to capture every detail in writing so that someone else can look at the transcription and see the same painting as if they were looking at the original.	transcription	Explain transcription using an analogy.

The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Ribonucleic acid polymerase is like a printer. It prints out the genetic instructions that are stored in DNA.	rna polymerase	Explain rna polymerase using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
RNA polymerase is a bit like a secretary who takes dictation. The 'secretary' listens to the boss (the DNA molecule) and writes down what it says. She then turns around and creates new pieces of paper (molecules of RNA) with all the information that the boss has communicated.	rna polymerase	Explain rna polymerase using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Ribosomes are like a construction crew. They build the proteins that our cells need to function.	ribosome	Explain ribosome using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.

The DNA is like the architect's plans, and the ribosomes follow the instructions to build the proteins that make up the body.	ribosome	Explain ribosome using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Ribosomes are similar to a type of printing press that manufactures all the proteins in your body. The ribosomes read a recipe for a protein that is stored in the DNA, and then they use special enzymes to "manufacture" the protein by linking together small pieces of amino acids that come from food.	ribosome	Explain ribosome using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
One way to think about activator proteins is as the " ignition switch" for a cellular process. Just like you need a key to start your car, activator proteins are necessary to turn on ( or activate) certain processes within cells. They do this by binding to other molecules called regulatory factors, which then help to control how genes are expressed	activator protein	Explain activator protein using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
An activator protein is like a key that unlocks the door to a room. The activator protein binds to another molecule called the receptor, and this opens up the door to the room so that other molecules can enter.	activator protein	Explain activator protein using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
The activator protein can be likened to a conductor of an orchestra. The activator protein binds to the promoter region of a gene and initiates transcription.	activator protein	Explain activator protein using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Electricity is like water in a hose. The voltage (pressure) is like the water pressure, and the current (flow) is like the amount of water flowing through the hose. Just as you can plug different size hoses into a faucet to get different amounts of water flow, you can use wires of different sizes to control how much electricity flows through a circuit.	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Electricity is like water. Just as water flows through a pipe, electricity flows through a wire. The voltage is the pressure of the electricity, and the current is how much flows through the wire at any given time. Like with water, you can control the flow of electricity by using switches to turn it on and off.	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
An electric circuit is like a group of people chatting in a room. The chatters are the electrons, and the room is the battery. When someone new joins the conversation (a spark), they jump from person to person, passing along their energy until they reach the end of the line (the lightbulb).	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
If you think of water molecules as a group of people, the hydrophobic effect would be like when all of the people in the group move away from one another. This creates empty spaces between them and makes it difficult for them to move around (or flow).	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
The hydrophobic effect is the tendency of water molecules to be repelled from one another. This can be best explained by using an analogy involving two magnets. If you have two bar magnets, and you try to push them together, they will naturally repel each other. This is because the poles of the magnets are attracted to each other, while the sides (which contain no magnetic pole) are repelled. In a similar way, water molecules are attracted to each other by their hydrogen bonds, but are repelled by the non-polar tails of the molecule.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
Hydrophobic effect is the tendency of nonpolar molecules to aggregate in aqueous solutions. This can be best explained by using an analogy with polarity and oil and water. think of oil as being nonpolar (hydrophobic) and water as being polar. When you try to mix them together, the oil will try to avoid the water by clumping together in droplets. this is because like charges repel each other while opposite charges attract. In a similar way, the hydrophobic molecules in a solution will try to group together to avoid contact with the water (polar) environment.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
The process of signal transduction can be thought of as a telephone line between two people. The sender is the person who initiates the call, and the receiver is the person who receives the call. Both parties need to have a phone line in order to communicate with each other. In order for a message to be sent from one person to another, it needs to go through the telephone line. This analogy can also be used to think about how messages are transmitted between cells. Cells use chemical messengers called hormones to communicate with each other. These hormones travel through cell membranes and bind to receptors on the surface of target cells. This triggers a series of events inside the target cell that leads to a response, such as cellular growth or division	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
A musician is playing a cello in a concert hall. The sound waves produced by the cello vibrate the air, which in turn causes the nearby walls and ceiling to vibrate. These vibrations cause tiny particles of dust to move around, and these movements create an electrical signal that can be detected by microphones. This electrical signal is analogous to a biological signal that is transmitted from one molecule to another.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
A musician tuning her violin can think of the strings as biological signals. When she plucks a string, it vibrates and sends energy traveling down the string. This energy is converted into sound waves that travel through the air and are heard by our ears. In a similar way, when a hormone or neurotransmitter binds to a receptor on a cell, it causes the cell to vibrate and send energy traveling down the membrane. This energy is converted into an electrical signal that travels through the cell and is used to control what happens inside it.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for an arts student.
