The cell wall is like a fence that surrounds the cells and keeps them from interacting with each other. It also helps to protect the cells from outside forces.	cell wall	Using a social science analogy, explain cell wall.
Cells are the smallest unit of life. They are like the individual people in a society. Each cell has its own unique identity and purpose within the larger organism. Cells work together to create tissues and organs that allow the organism to function as a whole.	cells	Using a social science analogy, explain cells.
Cells are like small towns in a country. Each town has its own mayor, who is responsible for the well-being of the townspeople. The cells in our bodies have a similar organization: each cell has a nucleus, which is responsible for the well-being of the cell and its contents.	cells	Using a social science analogy, explain cells.
Cells are the smallest unit of life. Just as in a society, cells have a variety of functions that allow them to work together for the good of the group. Cells produce energy, get rid of waste, protect themselves from invaders, and reproduce.	cells	Using a social science analogy, explain cells.
The cell membrane is like a fence that surrounds the cells and helps protect them from outside invaders. It also controls what goes in and out of the cell, allowing important nutrients to enter while keeping toxins and waste products out. The cell membrane is made up of two layers of fatty molecules called phospholipids, with proteins embedded in them. This creates a selective barrier that allows some substances to cross while preventing others from passing through.	cell membrane	Using a social science analogy, explain cell membrane.
A cell membrane is like a fence around a yard. The fence keeps things in (like the grass and flowers) and keeps things out (like dogs, cats, and other animals).

The Golgi apparatus is a cellular organelle found in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. It was first described by Camillo Golgi and named after him in 1898. The main function of the Golgi apparatus is to process and package proteins and lipids for transport within the cell, or export from the cell.	golgi body	Using a social science analogy, explain golgi body.
The Golgi body is a bit like the post office in your town. It receives packages from all over (the cell) and sorts them into different mailboxes for delivery to their proper destination. The Golgi also processes and prepares the packages for shipping, adding things like stamps and addresses.	golgi body	Using a social science analogy, explain golgi body.
A Golgi body is a cellular organelle which processes and packages proteins for transport within the cell. It does this by first synthesizing proteins in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, then transporting them to the cis-Golgi network. From here, specific proteins are selected and packaged into vesicles which bud off from the membrane of the Golgi body and travel to their destination within or outside of the cell.	golgi body	Using a social science analogy, explain golgi body.
Capacitance is a measure of how much electric charge can be stored on a capacitor. The capacitance of a capacitor is measured in Farads, and it depends on the size of the plates, the distance between them, and the type of dielectric material separating them.	capacitance	Using a social science analogy, explain capacitance.
A capacitor is a device that stores energy in an electric field. It does this by taking two metal plates and separating them with an insulating material. When you connect the battery to the capacitor, it starts to charge up. The more voltage you put on the capacitor, the more energy it will store.	capacitance	Using a social science analogy, explain capacitance.
A capacitor is like a container of water. The more water there is in the container, the higher the capacitance.	capacitance	Using a social science analogy, explain capacitance.

The higher the voltage, or electrical pressure, the faster the current will flow.	electric current	Using a social science analogy, explain electric current.
Electric current is like a river of electrons flowing through a wire. It can be used to power lights and appliances, or it can be stored in batteries to provide electrical power later on.	electric current	Using a social science analogy, explain electric current.

The higher the voltage of the power source, the faster and more powerful the current will be.	electric current	Using a social science analogy, explain electric current.
Voltage is the potential difference between two points in an electrical circuit. It is a measure of how much work can be done per unit of charge that flows through the circuit.	voltage	Using a social science analogy, explain voltage.
Voltage is the electrical pressure that causes current to flow. Voltage (measured in volts) is what makes currents flow through wires, and it can be likened to water pressure in a hose. The greater the voltage, the more powerful the current.	voltage	Using a social science analogy, explain voltage.
Voltage is a measure of the potential difference between two points in an electric field. It is analogous to water pressure, which is a measure of the potential energy per unit volume at any given point in a fluid. Just as higher water pressure can move more water through a pipe, so too can higher voltage drive more current through an electrical conductor.	voltage	Using a social science analogy, explain voltage.
A cell is like a small society, with many people working together for the benefit of the whole. Each person in the cell has a specific job to do, and they all specialize in that area. For example, some cells have specialists who create new proteins, while others have experts who manage energy production or recycling. In order for the cell to function properly, everyone needs to be able to communicate effectively. This means that messages need to be passed quickly and accurately from one part of the cell to another.	specialization and communication in a cell	Using a social science analogy, explain specialization and communication in a cell.
In a social science analogy, communication in a cell would be similar to the way people communicate with each other. Cells have specialized areas that allow them to communicate with each other and carry out specific tasks. just as people have different specialties (e.g., doctors, nurses, police officers), cells also have specialized areas that allow them to carry out specific tasks. For example, cells in the brain are responsible for processing information, while cells in the heart are responsible for pumping blood.	specialization and communication in a cell	Using a social science analogy, explain specialization and communication in a cell.
In a cell, specialization is when different parts of the cell do different things in order to keep the cell alive. Communication happens when different cells talk to each other in order to share information and coordinate their activities.	specialization and communication in a cell	Using a social science analogy, explain specialization and communication in a cell.
Kirchhoff's voltage law is similar to the conservation of energy principle in physics. Just as energy is neither created nor destroyed, but simply transferred or transformed, so too is electrical potential (voltage). The sum of all voltages around a closed loop must be zero. This means that the voltage at any given point in a circuit is equal to the sum of the individual voltages of all the components in series with that point, minus any voltage drops across resistors.	kirchoff's voltage law	Using a social science analogy, explain kirchoff's voltage law.
Kirchoff's voltage law states that the algebraic sum of all voltages in a loop is zero. This means that the total voltage around a closed loop is always 0.	kirchoff's voltage law	Using a social science analogy, explain kirchoff's voltage law.

A density wave is an oscillation of matter in a medium. It can be thought of as similar to a sound wave, which is an oscillation of air pressure. In the same way that a sound wave travels through the air, a density wave travels through a medium.	nature of a density wave	Using a social science analogy, explain nature of a density wave.
A density wave is a physical phenomenon that occurs when something disturbs the regular flow of particles in a medium. For example, imagine you are walking through a crowd of people. As you move forward, the people around you will be pushed aside by your movement. This creates a density wave that travels through the crowd as people are displaced from their original positions.	nature of a density wave	Using a social science analogy, explain nature of a density wave.
A density wave is a ripple of particles or energy that travels through a medium. It can be compared to the way sound waves travel through air, or the way water waves ripple across the surface of a pond. Density waves are created when something disturbs the equilibrium of a system. For example, when you drop a rock into a pool of water, it creates ripples that spread out in all directions. The same thing happens when an object moves through gas or liquid; it causes irregularities in the surrounding material which then propagate as waves.	nature of a density wave	Using a social science analogy, explain nature of a density wave.
Enzymes are like the workers in a factory. They are responsible for converting raw materials into products. In the case of enzymes, they convert proteins into other proteins, fats into other fats, and starches into other starches.	enzymes	Using a social science analogy, explain enzymes.

The human active memory system can be likened to a computer's random access memory (RAM). RAM is where the computer loads and stores the programs and data that are being used at any given time. The more RAM a computer has, the more programs and data it can store at once. Similarly, the more storage space in our active memory, the more information we can keep in mind simultaneously. Just as a computer needs an operating system to run its applications, our brain needs a framework or organization for the information it is trying to remember. This framework is provided by our long-term memory.	human active memory system	Using a social science analogy, explain human active memory system.
The human active memory system can be thought of as a library. The library has many books, and each book is kept in a specific place. To find a particular book, you need to know where it is located. The same is true for memories; you need to know where they are stored in order to access them.	human active memory system	Using a social science analogy, explain human active memory system.
The human active memory system is like a computer. It can store and process information. However, unlike a computer, the human active memory system also has the ability to create and use connections between different pieces of information. These connections help us remember things better and make it easier to learn new things.	human active memory system	Using a social science analogy, explain human active memory system.
The rate-determining step of a reaction is the slowest step in the reaction. This step determines how quickly the entire reaction occurs.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Using a social science analogy, explain rate-determining step of a reaction.
The rate-determining step of a reaction is the slowest step in the reaction. This is because the reactants need to collide with each other in order to form the product. The faster the steps leading up to this collision, the more likely it is that the reaction will happen.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Using a social science analogy, explain rate-determining step of a reaction.
The rate-determining step is the slowest step in a reaction. The rate of the reaction is determined by how fast this step can occur.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Using a social science analogy, explain rate-determining step of a reaction.
Column chromatography is a technique used to separate compounds in a mixture. The compounds are placed in a column and then a solvent is added. The solvent will move up the column and carry the compounds with it. The compounds will be separated based on their size, shape, and polarity.	column chromatography	Using a social science analogy, explain column chromatography.
Column chromatography is a technique used to separate complex mixtures into their individual chemical components. The mixture is placed in a column and a solvent is allowed to flow through it. The different compounds in the mixture are dissolved at different rates, so they move through the column at different speeds. The faster-dissolving compounds exit the column first, while the slower-dissolving compounds exit later. This allows the chemist to isolate each compound from the mixture.	column chromatography	Using a social science analogy, explain column chromatography.
Column chromatography is the process of separating a mixture into its component parts by passing it through a long, thin tube packed with material that selectively adsorbs (attaches to) one or more of the mixture's components. The different components are then eluted (extracted) from the column in order of their relative affinity for the adsorbent.	column chromatography	Using a social science analogy, explain column chromatography.
Dynamic chemical equilibrium is similar to a social group in which all of the members are interacting with each other. In equilibrium, the system is stable and no changes occur. However, in dynamic equilibrium, the system is always changing as the members interact with each other.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Using a social science analogy, explain dynamic chemical equilibrium.
Dynamic chemical equilibrium is like a social group that is constantly in flux. Members come and go, and the makeup of the group changes over time. However, despite all of the change, the group still maintains its overall identity. The same can be said for chemicals in a dynamic equilibrium; they are always changing, but their composition remains relatively stable.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Using a social science analogy, explain dynamic chemical equilibrium.
A social science analogy for dynamic chemical equilibrium would be a group of people who are constantly interacting with each other. The balance between the different groups is always changing, but at any given time there is a state of equilibrium where the different groups are in balance.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Using a social science analogy, explain dynamic chemical equilibrium.
A vacuole is like a small town in the social sciences. It has its own set of rules and regulations that govern how people interact with each other within it.

They help to move proteins and other molecules around the cell, which helps the cell function properly.	transport vesicles	Using a social science analogy, explain transport vesicles.
A possible analogy for transport vesicles would be cars on a highway. The cars are the transport vesicles and the highway is the cell membrane. The cars are able to move around on the highway, and they can carry things with them. Just like how a car can carry people or goods, a transport vesicle can carry proteins or other molecules within the cell.	transport vesicles	Using a social science analogy, explain transport vesicles.
Transport vesicles are like cars that transport things around the city. The nucleus is the city center, and the chromosomes are the passengers in the car. The DNA is what tells the car where to go and what to pick up along the way.	transport vesicles	Using a social science analogy, explain transport vesicles.

A tumor suppressor gene is a gene that helps to prevent the development of tumors. This gene produces a protein that helps to keep cells from growing and dividing too rapidly. If this gene is mutated or deleted, it can lead to the development of tumors.	tumor suppressor genes	Using a social science analogy, explain tumor suppressor genes.
Tumor suppressor genes are like the police of the cell. They patrol and monitor the DNA for errors, and when they find them, they fix them. If tumor suppressor genes are not working properly, it can allow cancerous cells to grow unchecked.	tumor suppressor genes	Using a social science analogy, explain tumor suppressor genes.
Tumor suppressor genes are like the police of the body. They keep cells from growing and dividing too quickly or in an uncontrolled way, which can lead to cancer.	tumor suppressor genes	Using a social science analogy, explain tumor suppressor genes.
One way to think of brittle software is as a house of cards. If you disturb one card, the whole thing falls down. Brittle software is also vulnerable to changes in its environment. For example, if the operating system on which it runs changes, or if the hardware it uses is replaced, the software may no longer work properly.	brittle software	Using a social science analogy, explain brittle software.

A resonance hybrid is a molecule formed from two or more atoms that have been joined together by covalent bonds. The atoms in a resonance hybrid are held together by delocalized electrons, which circulate around the atom-pairs in such a way that the whole molecule has an overall lower energy than any of the individual atomic species would have.	resonance hybrid	Using a social science analogy, explain resonance hybrid.

A wave mechanical model is like a social network. It consists of nodes (or people) and edges (or relationships between the nodes). The waves represent how information travels through the network. In a social network, information can travel quickly from one person to another if they are connected by a strong edge. However, if there are no strong edges connecting two people, the information will travel more slowly.	wave mechanical model	Using a social science analogy, explain wave mechanical model.
The wave mechanical model is similar to a group of people standing in line at a movie theater. The people are the waves and the line is the space between them. As each new person arrives, they stand behind the last person in line. This represents how each wave builds on top of the previous one.	wave mechanical model	Using a social science analogy, explain wave mechanical model.
A wave mechanical model is used to describe the behavior of a particle in a periodic potential. In this model, the position of the particle is described by a wavefunction, which oscillates with time.

A social science analogy for an electroencephalogram would be like taking the temperature of a large group of people to get a sense for the overall climate. An EEG is used to measure and record the electrical activity in your brain. It can help doctors diagnose problems with your brain, such as seizures or tumors.	electroencephalogram	Using a social science analogy, explain electroencephalogram.
EEG is a measure of the electrical activity of the brain. It can be used to detect abnormalities in brain function, such as seizures.	electroencephalogram	Using a social science analogy, explain electroencephalogram.
An electroencephalogram is like a group of people sitting in a room talking. Each person's conversation can be heard, but it is difficult to make out what any one person is saying without being right next to them. Similarly, the EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain, and different parts of the brain will produce different signals. However, it is difficult to determine what any one signal means without knowing specifically which part of the brain produced it.	electroencephalogram	Using a social science analogy, explain electroencephalogram.
DNA replication can be thought of as a photocopier. The DNA molecule is the original document, and each time the photocopier makes a copy, it produces an exact replica.

DNA replication is similar to photocopying a document. The DNA molecule is the original document, and each time it replicates, it produces two copies - just like when you make a copy of a document on your photocopier.	dna replication	Using a social science analogy, explain dna replication.
DNA replication is similar to the process of photocopying a document. The DNA molecule is like the original document, and the copies are the photocopies. During replication, the two strands of DNA that make up the molecule separate, and each strand serves as a template for making a new strand. Enzymes called polymerases help to assemble these new strands by matching up pairs of nucleotides (the building blocks of DNA) according to specific instructions provided by the sequence of bases in the template strand.	dna replication	Using a social science analogy, explain dna replication.
RNA transcription is the process by which a strand of rna is copied from a dna molecule. This occurs in the nucleus of cells, and the new rna transcript is then exported to the cytoplasm where it can be used to make proteins.	rna transcription	Using a social science analogy, explain rna transcription.
Rna transcription can be thought of as a social science analogy in the following way: rna is like a paper copy of a conversation that has taken place, where the transcription is an accurate record of what was said. Just as importantly, it is also a record of who said it and when. In the same way, rna transcripts helps to keep track of which genes are being expressed (turned on) at any given time.	rna transcription	Using a social science analogy, explain rna transcription.
In molecular biology, transcription is the process of copying genetic information from a DNA molecule to a related RNA molecule. During transcription, the DNA double helix is unwound and the hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs are broken. This exposes single strands of DNA which can be used as templates for building the new RNA strand. Transcription occurs in the cell nucleus, where the enzymes that make RNA are located.	rna transcription	Using a social science analogy, explain rna transcription.
Protein translation is the process of creating a protein molecule from an mRNA sequence. The ribosome reads the mRNA and assembles amino acids to form a protein chain.	protein translation	Using a social science analogy, explain protein translation.
The process of protein translation is similar to the process of a group of people translating a document from one language to another. The text is first divided up into smaller parts, and then each part is translated by a different person. Once all the parts are translated, they are put back together to create the final product.	protein translation	Using a social science analogy, explain protein translation.
Protein translation is a bit like the assembly line of a factory.

A social science analogy for ecosystem would be a human society. Just as there are different parts of a human society (e.g., the government, businesses, citizens), there are different parts of an ecosystem (e.g., plants, animals, air, water). Just as each part of a human society has an important role to play in keeping the whole functioning well, each part of an ecosystem has an important role to play in keeping the whole functioning well.	ecosystem	Using a social science analogy, explain ecosystem.
The propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to the propagation of a message through a social network. The action potential starts at the point where the stimulus was applied (the "sender") and travels down the neuron's axon to its terminal buttons. At each junction between two cells, the action potential causes chemicals called neurotransmitters to be released into the space between them. These neurotransmitters travel across the gap and attach themselves to receptors on the next cell, causing that cell to become excited and generate its own action potential. This process continues until the message reaches the end of the neuron, where it is transmitted to muscles or glands.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Using a social science analogy, explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron.
A social science analogy can help explain how an action potential travels down a neuron. When someone sends a text message, the message is sent through a series of telephone networks until it reaches the recipient's phone. Each network relays the message along and eventually it arrives at the correct phone. Analogously, when an action potential travels down a neuron, it passes through each segment of the neuron in succession. The segments act as relay stations, passing on the signal until it reachs the end of the neuron.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Using a social science analogy, explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron.
The propagation of an action potential down a neuron can be thought of as the spreading of a rumor down a social network. The initial stimulus (the rumor) is small, but it quickly grows in magnitude as it spreads from person to person. Likewise, the initial electrical pulse (action potential) starts off small, but it rapidly amplifies as it travels down the neuron.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Using a social science analogy, explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron.
The breathing mechanism of frogs is very similar to the way humans breathe. Frogs take in air through their nostrils, and then it passes through the throat and into the lungs. From there, the frog expels carbon dioxide and takes in oxygen.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Using a social science analogy, explain breathing mechanism of frogs.
The frog's breathing mechanism is similar to that of humans in that they use their lungs to breathe. However, frogs also have a special system called the circulatory lung which allows them to take in oxygen from the water. This system consists of two chambers on either side of the frog's body which can be filled with water when the frog is submerged. When the frog surfaces, it pushes air into these chambers, filling them with oxygen which is then diffused into the rest of the body.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Using a social science analogy, explain breathing mechanism of frogs.
Just as humans use their lungs to breathe, frogs use their skin to respire. Frogs have a large surface area on their skin and they can unzip their sides to increase the surface area even more. When the frog is in water, it takes in dissolved oxygen from the water through its skin and when it is out of the water, it breathes in air. The frog's heart also helps with respiration by pumping blood throughout its body so that the oxygen can diffuse into tissues.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Using a social science analogy, explain breathing mechanism of frogs.
A social science analogy can be used to explain layered architecture. In a social science setting, like in sociology for example, there are different levels of analysis that can be used to examine a problem or issue. The first level of analysis is the micro level which looks at individuals and small groups. The second level of analysis is the meso level which looks at medium sized groups such as organizations or institutions. And finally, the macro level is the third and highest level of analysis which looks at large scale phenomena and global issues.Just like with social sciences, in computer programming there are different layers of abstraction that allow for more complex systems to be built on top of simpler systems. The lowest layer in this case would be the hardware layer which consists of all the physical components that make up a computer system. On top of that would be the software layer which consists of all the programs and applications that run on a computer system. Finally, there is the user interface layer which allows users to interact with those programs and applications.	layered architecture	Using a social science analogy, explain layered architecture.
A good analogy to understand layered architecture is the different layers of an onion. Just like you can peel away the layers of an onion one by one, you can also access different parts of a computer system by accessing its various layers. The lowest layer is the hardware, which consists of the physical components of a computer system such as the Central Processing Unit (CPU), motherboard, and memory. The software layer sits on top of the hardware and includes all the programs that run on a computer, such as Windows or macOS. Finally, there is the user interface (UI) layer, which consists of all the graphical elements that users see and interact with when using a program or operating system. By understanding these three layers, you can better troubleshoot problems with your computer and know where to look for specific information or files.	layered architecture	Using a social science analogy, explain layered architecture.
A social science analogy for layered architecture would be the study of a human society. A sociologist might look at the individual, then family, then neighborhood, city, and country levels to get a better understanding of how humans interact with each other. In the same way, a software engineer might use layered architecture to create an application that is organized in a way that makes it easy to understand and modify. The individual layer might be the user interface, while the family layer could be all of the code necessary to display information on a web page. The neighborhood layer could include code for interacting with a database or retrieving data from another server. The city level could include code for processing input or managing files. And finally the country level could include low-level system functions such as communicating with other applications or devices on the network	layered architecture	Using a social science analogy, explain layered architecture.
A limiting reactant is a chemical that limits the amount of product that can be formed in a chemical reaction. The excess reactant is the other chemical present in excess relative to the limiting reactant.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Using a social science analogy, explain limiting reactant and excess reactant.
In chemistry, a limiting reactant is the reactant in a chemical reaction that determines how much of the product can be formed. The other reactants are called excess reactants. For example, if you have two liters of hydrogen gas and one liter of oxygen gas, and you want to make water vapor, then the hydrogen will be the limiting factor. You can only produce as much water vapor as there are atoms of hydrogen in the mixture.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Using a social science analogy, explain limiting reactant and excess reactant.
A limiting reactant is the substance that limits the amount of product that can be formed in a chemical reaction. The excess reactant is the substance that remains after the limiting reactant has been used up.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Using a social science analogy, explain limiting reactant and excess reactant.

RNA polymerase is a protein that helps create new RNA strands by linking together individual nucleotides. It does this by catalyzing the formation of phosphodiester bonds between the 3' hydroxyl group on one ribonucleotide and the 5' phosphate group on the next ribonucleotide. This process is essential for creating new RNA molecules, including mRNA transcripts which are used to translate genetic information into proteins.	rna polymerase	Using a social science analogy, explain rna polymerase.

The nonpolar molecules are then pushed to the outside of the droplet, where they are less likely to come into contact with water.	hydrophobic effect	Using a social science analogy, explain hydrophobic effect.
The hydrophobic effect is the tendency of nonpolar molecules to aggregate in an aqueous environment. This occurs because polar molecules, which are attracted to water, push the nonpolar molecules away. The nonpolar molecules then group together in order to avoid contact with the polar molecules.	hydrophobic effect	Using a social science analogy, explain hydrophobic effect.
Biological signal transduction is the process by which a cell converts a biochemical signal into an electrical or mechanical response. This process can be thought of as similar to how a telephone works. A caller speaks into the phone, and their voice is converted into an electrical signal that travels through the wires to the receiver. The receiver then converts the electrical signal back into sound waves that you hear on the other end of the line. In much the same way, cells convert biochemical signals into electrical or mechanical responses.	biological signal transduction	Using a social science analogy, explain biological signal transduction.
A social science analogy for signal transduction would be the way a telephone line transmits sound. The phone line is like the cell membrane, and the electrical current running through it is like the signal (in this case, sound). When you speak into the phone, your voice creates an electrical current in the microphone. This current travels down the phone line to the other person's phone, where it triggers a similar current that recreates your voice on their end.	biological signal transduction	Using a social science analogy, explain biological signal transduction.
Biological signal transduction is the process by which a molecule in one part of a cell communicates with another part of the same cell or with other cells to relay a message. The molecule that initiates the signal is called a receptor, and the molecules it communicates with are called effectors. Receptors are found on the surface of cells or in their cytoplasm, and they can be activated by different types of signals, including hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines, and growth factors. Once activated, receptors interact with intracellular proteins known as kinases to initiate a cascade of biochemical reactions that ultimately leads to changes in gene expression.	biological signal transduction	Using a social science analogy, explain biological signal transduction.
