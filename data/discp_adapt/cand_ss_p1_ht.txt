Similarly, social scientists study the genetic makeup (i.e., genes) of populations in order to understand how they interact with their environment and evolve over time	chromosome	Using an analogy, explain chromosome to a social science student.
Chromosomes are like a recipe for how to make a person. They have all the instructions needed to create a human being.	chromosome	Using an analogy, explain chromosome to a social science student.
Cytosol is like the water in a fish tank. It surrounds all of the cells in the fish tank and provides them with what they need to survive. Cytosol is made up of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, minerals, and other small molecules. It helps to keep the cells in the fish tank healthy by providing them with nutrients and removing waste products.	cytosol	Using an analogy, explain cytosol to a social science student.
The cytosol is like the water in a fish tank. It surrounds and supports all of the cells in the fish tank. Likewise, the cytosol surrounds and supports all of the cells in our body.	cytosol	Using an analogy, explain cytosol to a social science student.
The cytosol is like the water in a lake. It is mostly made up of H2O, but it also contains dissolved minerals and other chemicals. The cytosol provides a medium for cells to communicate with each other and to carry out their functions.	cytosol	Using an analogy, explain cytosol to a social science student.
A cell is the smallest living unit of an organism. It is made up of a membrane, cytoplasm, and DNA. The cell membrane separates the inside of the cell from its environment and controls what enters and leaves the cell. The cytoplasm contains organelles which perform different functions in the cell such as producing energy or making proteins. The DNA stores genetic information which determines how a particular organism will grow and develop.	cell	Using an analogy, explain cell to a social science student.
A social science student may not be familiar with the concept of a cell. A cell is the smallest unit of life. It is the basic building block of all living things. Cells are very small and can only be seen under a microscope.	cell	Using an analogy, explain cell to a social science student.
A social science student might not understand the concept of a cell if you were to try and explain it in terms of their area of study. A more appropriate analogy would be to compare cells to cities. Just as each city has its own unique set of buildings, roads, and inhabitants, each cell has its own unique set of proteins, organelles, and DNA. Cells are also organized into hierarchical structures; just as cities are divided into neighborhoods, suburbs, and downtown areas, cells are divided into the nucleus (downtown), the cytoplasm (the suburbs), and the membrane (the outskirts).	cell	Using an analogy, explain cell to a social science student.
A vesicle is like a small container that can hold things in it. Vesicles are found inside of cells and they help to carry things around inside the cell.	vesicles	Using an analogy, explain vesicles to a social science student.

A cell wall is like a fence that surrounds a yard. The fence helps to keep things in the yard and keeps people from coming into the yard without permission. The cell wall does the same thing for cells. It helps to keep things in the cell and keeps other cells from coming into the cell.	cell wall	Using an analogy, explain cell wall to a social science student.
A cell wall is like a fortress that protects the cells inside from invaders. It is made up of tough, rigid materials that can keep out bacteria and other unwanted guests.	cell wall	Using an analogy, explain cell wall to a social science student.
Cells are the basic building blocks of life. Just as a city is made up of many individual houses, cells are the smallest unit of an organism. Cells come in many shapes and sizes, and each has a specific job to do in order for the organism to survive.	cells	Using an analogy, explain cells to a social science student.
Cells are like people in a social science class. They are small and each has its own job, but they all work together to create something larger than themselves. Cells come in different shapes and sizes, just as people do. And cells can be divided into smaller parts, just as people can be divided into smaller groups.	cells	Using an analogy, explain cells to a social science student.
Cells are like the people in a country. The cells make up the tissues and organs of the body just as the citizens make up the government and society. Cells work together to keep everything functioning, just as people work together to keep their country running smoothly.	cells	Using an analogy, explain cells to a social science student.
 Imagine the cell membrane as a border or fence. It is what separates the inside of the cell from everything else outside. The material of the fence can be thought of as being made up of cells that are joined together. Just like in a real border fence, there are gates (called pores) in the membrane that allow things to move back and forth between the inside and outside of the cell.	cell membrane	Using an analogy, explain cell membrane to a social science student.
The cell membrane can be thought of as a border or gatekeeper between the inside and outside of the cell. It is made up of a lipid bilayer, which is composed of two layers of fatty molecules. The purpose of the cell membrane is to selectively allow certain substances to enter or exit the cell.	cell membrane	Using an analogy, explain cell membrane to a social science student.
A cell membrane can be thought of as a social group's borders. Just as a country has physical borders to keep people in or out, a cell has a membrane that regulates what goes in and out. The membrane is made up of molecules called lipids, which form a barrier that keeps things like proteins and DNA from crossing the border.	cell membrane	Using an analogy, explain cell membrane to a social science student.
The Golgi body is a bit like the post office in that it handles the delivery and sorting of parcels (in this case, proteins). It receives proteins from other parts of the cell, modifies them, and then sends them off to their final destination.	golgi body	Using an analogy, explain golgi body to a social science student.

Capacitance is a measure of how much electric charge can be stored in an object. It is analogous to the amount of water that can be held in a container.	capacitance	Using an analogy, explain capacitance to a social science student.
A capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy in an electric field. It does this by having two metal plates separated by an insulator. The more charge you put on the plates, the more energy the capacitor can store.	capacitance	Using an analogy, explain capacitance to a social science student.
A capacitor is like a tank of water. The more water you have in the tank, the higher the pressure will be at the bottom of the tank. Similarly, capacitance is a measure of how much electric charge can be stored in an object. The more charge that is stored, the higher the voltage will be on the object.	capacitance	Using an analogy, explain capacitance to a social science student.
Electric current can be thought of as the flow of electricity through a wire. Just like water flowing through a pipe, electricity flows through wires in a certain direction. The strength of the current is measured in amperes (amps).	electric current	Using an analogy, explain electric current to a social science student.
Electric current is like a river of electricity flowing through a wire. Just as rivers flow downhill, electric current flows from the higher voltage to the lower voltage. This makes it possible to power lights and appliances with electricity.	electric current	Using an analogy, explain electric current to a social science student.
Electric current is much like a river of electricity. It flows steadily and can power things as it goes. Just like a river, electric current can be used to do work (like turn on a light) or it can be harnessed to create energy (like in a hydroelectric dam).	electric current	Using an analogy, explain electric current to a social science student.
Voltage can be thought of as the "pressure" behind an electric current. Just as water pressure is necessary to move water through a pipe, voltage is necessary to move electrons through a conductor.	voltage	Using an analogy, explain voltage to a social science student.
Voltage is like the electricity in your house. It's what makes the lights turn on, the TV work, and the refrigerator run. Voltage is a measure of how much power is flowing through a circuit.	voltage	Using an analogy, explain voltage to a social science student.
Voltage is like the pressure of a fluid. Just as water flows downhill under the influence of gravity, electric current will flow through a conductor (like metal) when voltage is applied. The higher the voltage, the more force it has to push electrons along and the greater electrical potential energy it possesses.	voltage	Using an analogy, explain voltage to a social science student.
A cell is like a small city. It has specialized areas for different functions, such as housing, manufacturing, and transportation. The cells also communicate with each other to coordinate their activities.	specialization and communication in a cell	Using an analogy, explain specialization and communication in a cell to a social science student.
In a cell, specialization is the process by which different parts of the cell carry out specific functions. For example, in a human cell, the nucleus carries out the function of DNA replication and transcription, while the cytoplasm carries out protein synthesis. Communication between different specialized parts of a cells allows them to work together to carry out complex tasks. In social science terms, this would be analogous to communication between different departments in a company or organization. This communication allows each department to understand its role within the larger whole and to cooperatively achieve common goals.	specialization and communication in a cell	Using an analogy, explain specialization and communication in a cell to a social science student.
A single cell is a community of specialized bacteria that each carry out a specific job in order to keep the cell alive and functioning. For example, some bacteria are responsible for digesting food, others produce energy, and still others maintain the cell's structure. In order for these different bacteria to work together efficiently, they must be able to communicate with one another. This communication occurs through chemical signals that allow the cells to share information about what type of jobs need to be done and when they should be done.	specialization and communication in a cell	Using an analogy, explain specialization and communication in a cell to a social science student.
Kirchoff's voltage law is a statement that the algebraic sum of voltages around a loop is zero. This means that if you start at any point in a circuit and follow the path of the electrons, the total voltage they experience will be zero when they reach their starting point again. This law is important for understanding how electrical circuits work, because it allows us to calculate the voltages across different parts of a circuit without actually having to measure them.	kirchoff's voltage law	Using an analogy, explain kirchoff's voltage law to a social science student.
Just as there is a flow of water in a river, so too is there a flow of electricity in wires. This flow is called voltage. Kirchoff's Voltage Law states that the sum of all voltages around a closed loop is zero. In other words, the total amount of electricity flowing into and out of any point in a circuit must be equal	kirchoff's voltage law	Using an analogy, explain kirchoff's voltage law to a social science student.
Kirchoff's voltage law states that the sum of all voltages around a loop is zero. This analogy can be used to explain this law in terms of social science. Imagine a group of people standing in a circle, with each person holding hands with the people on either side of them. If you were to walk around the outside of the circle, your journey would trace out a loop. Now imagine that as you walked, you counted how many volts (energy) passed through your body from one person to the next. You would find that the total amount of energy passing through your body was zero; no matter where you went in the circle, the sum of all voltages would be zero. This is because when two people are holding hands, they share their energy equally between them.	kirchoff's voltage law	Using an analogy, explain kirchoff's voltage law to a social science student.
A density wave is like a crowd of people walking through a city. The people are clustered together in some areas and spread out in other areas.	nature of a density wave	Using an analogy, explain nature of a density wave to a social science student.
A density wave is a phenomenon that can be observed in social settings. Just as waves can be seen on the surface of water, density waves can be seen in human populations. These waves are caused by changes in the population's distribution of people. For example, when a large group of people moves into an area, the wave will move outward from that point. Density waves often occur during times of rapid population growth or movement.	nature of a density wave	Using an analogy, explain nature of a density wave to a social science student.
A density wave is a type of social movement that occurs when people move in groups to occupy a certain space. The wave can be seen as it moves through the area, and often leaves behind evidence of its presence (e.g., trash, graffiti, etc.).	nature of a density wave	Using an analogy, explain nature of a density wave to a social science student.
Enzymes are like tiny machines that help the body do its work. They are found in all living things and help break down food, make new cells, and heal wounds.	enzymes	Using an analogy, explain enzymes to a social science student.
Enzymes are like tiny machines that help to break down food in our bodies. They work by attaching themselves to the food, and then using their energy to chop it up into smaller pieces. This makes it easier for our digestive system to take in and use.	enzymes	Using an analogy, explain enzymes to a social science student.
Enzymes are like tiny machines that help chemical reactions happen in the body. They are produced by the liver and work to break down food into molecules that the body can use for energy or to build new cells.	enzymes	Using an analogy, explain enzymes to a social science student.
The human active memory system can be compared to a computer's random access memory (RAM). The RAM is where the computer keeps the programs and data that are currently being used. When you need to use a program or open a file, your computer quickly retrieves it from the RAM. The human active memory works in much the same way. We keep information in our active memory as long as we need it so that we can easily access it when we need it. For instance, if you are having a conversation with someone, you will likely remember most of what they said after the conversation is over. That information was stored in your active memory while you were talking to them and was then quickly forgotten once you stopped talking.	human active memory system	Using an analogy, explain human active memory system to a social science student.
Your brain can be thought of as a computer. When you are born, your brain has a lot of space to store information. As you learn new things, bits and pieces of information are stored in different parts of your brain. This is like saving files on your computer's hard drive. Just as important files can get scattered all over your computer, important bits of information can get scattered throughout your brain.The active memory system is like the RAM (random access memory) on your computer. It is what you use when you are working on something and need to remember a phone number or an address. The active memory system keeps the most important information right at hand so that you can use it when you need it.	human active memory system	Using an analogy, explain human active memory system to a social science student.
The human active memory system can be thought of as a library. The library has many shelves, and each shelf is filled with books. In order to find a specific book, you must know the title or author of the book. Once you know where the book is located, you can pull it off the shelf and read it. The human active memory system works in a similar way. In order to remember something, you must first encode it into your brain. This encoding process involves creating a mental representation of the information that can be stored in your active memory. Once the information is encoded, you can access it later by recalling themental representation that was created during encoding.	human active memory system	Using an analogy, explain human active memory system to a social science student.
The rate-determining step is the slowest step in a reaction. It determines how fast or slow the reaction will happen.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Using an analogy, explain rate-determining step of a reaction to a social science student.
When two people are talking, the rate-determining step is the moment when one person stops talking and the other person starts.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Using an analogy, explain rate-determining step of a reaction to a social science student.
The rate-determining step of a reaction is the slowest step in a chemical reaction. This step determines the overall speed of a reaction. In social science, the rate-determining step is often the most important part of a process, as it determines how quickly something can happen.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Using an analogy, explain rate-determining step of a reaction to a social science student.
Column chromatography is a technique used to separate mixtures of compounds. The mixture is placed in a column and then a solvent (usually water) is pumped through the column. The different compounds in the mixture will move at different rates through the column, so they can be separated.	column chromatography	Using an analogy, explain column chromatography to a social science student.
Column chromatography is a technique used to separate the components of a mixture. The mixture is poured into a column and then a solvent is slowly added. As the solvent travels up the column, it pulls the different components of the mixture out of the column one by one. The components are then collected at different points along the column, depending on how quickly they travel through the solvent.	column chromatography	Using an analogy, explain column chromatography to a social science student.
Column chromatography is a technique used to separate the different compounds in a mixture. The mixture is placed in a column and then a solvent is slowly added. The different compounds will travel through the column at different speeds, so they can be separated.	column chromatography	Using an analogy, explain column chromatography to a social science student.
Dynamic chemical equilibrium is like a group of friends who are all equally popular. No one person in the group is more popular than any other, and they all get along well. In the same way, at dynamic chemical equilibrium, the concentrations of all the reactants and products are equal.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Using an analogy, explain dynamic chemical equilibrium to a social science student.
Just as a population of bacteria in a Petri dish will eventually reach equilibrium where the number of live and dead bacteria is the same, so too will chemical reactions in a closed system (like a beaker or flask) reach equilibrium where the reactants are converted into products at the same rate they are formed. This state is called dynamic chemical equilibrium, and it occurs when there is no net change in concentration of any of the chemicals involved in the reaction.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Using an analogy, explain dynamic chemical equilibrium to a social science student.
Dynamic chemical equilibrium can be best described as a situation in which two opposing forces are balanced. In the social science context, this might be used to describe a political system in which there is a balance of power between different groups.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Using an analogy, explain dynamic chemical equilibrium to a social science student.

A vacuole is like a storage container in a cell. It can store different materials, such as water, food, or waste products.	vacuole	Using an analogy, explain vacuole to a social science student.
In transport vesicles, goods or materials are transported from one part of a cell to another. The process is similar to how goods are transported in a city. In both cases, there is a delivery system that moves the goods around. In cells, this delivery system is made up of tiny vesicles that travel through the cytoplasm. Like streets in a city, the cytoplasm has pathways that allow the vesicles to move easily from one place to another.	transport vesicles	Using an analogy, explain transport vesicles to a social science student.
A transport vesicle can be thought of as a small bus that transports materials (like proteins) between different parts of the cell. The material is loaded onto the bus in one location, and then unloaded at its destination.	transport vesicles	Using an analogy, explain transport vesicles to a social science student.
A transport vesicle is like a bus. It transports proteins and other molecules around the cell.	transport vesicles	Using an analogy, explain transport vesicles to a social science student.
A proto-oncogene is like a "risk factor" for cancer. Just as smoking cigarettes increases your risk of lung cancer, having a proto-oncogene increases your risk of developing cancer. However, not everyone who smokes will develop lung cancer, and not everyone with a proto-oncogene will develop cancer. Many other factors (such as exposure to carcinogens) also contribute to the development of cancer.	proto-oncogenes	Using an analogy, explain proto-oncogenes to a social science student.
Proto-oncogenes are like the early warning signs of cancer. Just like a social science student might be alerted to potential problems in their community by watching for early warning signs, proto-oncogenes allow cells to monitor their own health and correct any problems before they become serious. If something goes wrong, these genes can start promoting tumor growth, leading to cancer.	proto-oncogenes	Using an analogy, explain proto-oncogenes to a social science student.
Proto-oncogenes are like a group of people who have the potential to become criminals. They may not have committed any crimes yet, but they have the potential to do so. Oncogenes, on the other hand, are like criminals who have already committed crimes.	proto-oncogenes	Using an analogy, explain proto-oncogenes to a social science student.
Oncogenes are like viruses that can cause cancer. They are genes that have the potential to turn normal cells into cancer cells.	oncogenes	Using an analogy, explain oncogenes to a social science student.
Oncogenes are like the "tumor suppressor genes" - they can be thought of as the brakes on cell growth. Normally, when a cell receives a signal to divide, it will first check to see if its oncogenes are turned on. If they are, the cell will hold off on dividing, because it knows that doing so could lead to cancer. Cancer occurs when cells start dividing unchecked, thanks to mutations in their tumor suppressor genes.	oncogenes	Using an analogy, explain oncogenes to a social science student.
An oncogene is a gene that can cause cancer. It is similar to a "normal" gene in that it is made up of DNA and is used to create proteins. However, oncogenes have the ability to turn cells into cancer cells. This can happen if the oncogene is mutated (changed), or if it becomes overactive.	oncogenes	Using an analogy, explain oncogenes to a social science student.
Tumor suppressor genes are like the police officers of the body. They help to keep cells from growing out of control and becoming tumors.	tumor suppressor genes	Using an analogy, explain tumor suppressor genes to a social science student.
Tumor suppressor genes can be thought of as the police force of the cell. They are responsible for making sure that cells do not grow and divide out of control, which could lead to the development of a tumor.	tumor suppressor genes	Using an analogy, explain tumor suppressor genes to a social science student.
A tumor suppressor gene is like a policeman in the city. The policeman's job is to keep the city safe by arresting criminals and preventing crime. In the same way, tumor suppressor genes keep our cells safe by arresting tumors (preventing them from growing) and repairing damaged DNA.	tumor suppressor genes	Using an analogy, explain tumor suppressor genes to a social science student.
A brittle software system is one that breaks easily and is difficult to fix. It might be compared to a ceramic mug that shatters when dropped on the floor. A social science student might understand this analogy by thinking about how social systems are often unpredictable and can easily break down when stressors are applied.	brittle software	Using an analogy, explain brittle software to a social science student.
Brittle software is like a house of cards. In order for it to remain standing, every component must be strong and in balance. If even one card is moved or removed, the entire structure falls apart.	brittle software	Using an analogy, explain brittle software to a social science student.
 brittle software is like a ceramic cup. It looks strong and sturdy, but if you drop it or hit it with too much force, it will shatter into pieces.	brittle software	Using an analogy, explain brittle software to a social science student.
Resonance hybrid is a model that combines the best features of two or more theories to provide a more accurate description of a phenomenon. It is often used in social science when there are competing theories that cannot be easily reconciled.	resonance hybrid	Using an analogy, explain resonance hybrid to a social science student.
Resonance hybrids are molecules formed by atoms that have multiple electrons in their outer shells. These atoms can share their electrons with other atoms, forming covalent bonds. In some cases, the sharing of electrons can create a special type of bond called a resonance hybrid. This occurs when two or more Lewis structures for a molecule can be drawn, and each structure has different electron-pair distributions. The bonding in the resonance hybrid is not as strong as it would be in any of the individual Lewis structures, but it is stronger than if the atoms just shared electrons equally.	resonance hybrid	Using an analogy, explain resonance hybrid to a social science student.
A resonance hybrid is a molecule that is made up of more than one type of atom. These atoms are held together by chemical bonds. The different types of atoms in the molecule will vibrate at their own frequencies. When these frequencies are combined, they create a new frequency that is higher than any of the individual frequencies. This new frequency is what makes the resonance hybrid possible.	resonance hybrid	Using an analogy, explain resonance hybrid to a social science student.
A wave mechanical model is similar to a ripple effect. When something disturbs the surface of water, it creates a ripple that travels outward. The disturbance (in this case, the object) is the cause of the waves, and the waves are the result. In physics, this type of model is used to explain how energy travels through matter.	wave mechanical model	Using an analogy, explain wave mechanical model to a social science student.
A wave mechanical model is a way of understanding the behavior of particles in a system. In social science, this might be used to understand how people interact with each other or how groups behave. The wave mechanical model uses equations to describe the movement of particles and their interactions. This can help to explain things like diffusion, momentum, and energy transfer.	wave mechanical model	Using an analogy, explain wave mechanical model to a social science student.
A wave mechanical model is similar to a ripple in a pond. The disturbance (ripple) starts at one point and spreads outwards until it becomes undetectable. In terms of waves, this can be thought of as the crest or high point of the wave travelling from the source to the end.	wave mechanical model	Using an analogy, explain wave mechanical model to a social science student.
An EEG is a lot like taking the temperature of a room. You can get an idea of what is going on in the room by measuring the average temperature.

An electroencephalogram is a test that measures the electrical activity in your brain. This test is used to help diagnose problems with your brain, such as seizures or tumors.	electroencephalogram	Using an analogy, explain electroencephalogram to a social science student.
Replication is like making a copy of a file on your computer. The original file remains unchanged, but you have a copy of it that you can work with. DNA replication is similar - the original DNA molecule remains unchanged, but each strand of DNA is copied to create two new strands.	dna replication	Using an analogy, explain dna replication to a social science student.
DNA replication can be thought of as a photocopier. The genetic information in the original DNA molecule is copied, and each copy contains all of the information from the original.	dna replication	Using an analogy, explain dna replication to a social science student.
Replication of DNA is similar to making a copy of a document. The original document is the DNA, and the copies are the daughter cells.	dna replication	Using an analogy, explain dna replication to a social science student.
RNA transcription is a bit like making a copy of a document. The original document is the DNA, and the copied document is the RNA.	rna transcription	Using an analogy, explain rna transcription to a social science student.
Rna transcription is similar to a social science student writing an essay. The rna transcriptor is the writer, and the genes are the topic of the essay. The rna transcriptor assembles the correct sequence of nucleotides based on the genetic code in order to create a strand of rna. This strand of rna will then be used as a template for protein synthesis.	rna transcription	Using an analogy, explain rna transcription to a social science student.
Rna transcription is similar to a social science student taking notes in class. The rna molecule is like the student, and the base pairs are like the words on the blackboard. As the teacher speaks, the student writes down what she says. In this way, the information is copied from one place to another.	rna transcription	Using an analogy, explain rna transcription to a social science student.
Protein translation is a bit like making a sandwich. The bread is the mRNA and the meat, cheese and veggies are the protein. The translator (enzyme) is like the chef, who assembles everything in just the right way so that it's delicious!	protein translation	Using an analogy, explain protein translation to a social science student.
In social science, one might learn about the translations of ancient manuscripts. Protein translation is similar in that it involves taking the original message and making a new version, but with proteins instead of words. In order to create a protein, the genetic code must be read and converted into an amino acid sequence. This process happens in the cytoplasm of cells and is directed by transfer RNAs (tRNAs). Each tRNA binds to a specific codon on the mRNA strand and brings along its corresponding amino acid. The ribosome then links these amino acids together to form a protein molecule.	protein translation	Using an analogy, explain protein translation to a social science student.
Protein translation is the process of converting genetic code into proteins. Proteins play a major role in all aspects of biology, including cell structure, metabolism and signaling. In social science, proteins can be thought of as analogous to institutions. Just as proteins are essential for life, institutions are essential for human societies to function. Like proteins, institutions undergo constant change; they evolve over time in response to new needs and challenges.	protein translation	Using an analogy, explain protein translation to a social science student.
A social science student might not be familiar with the term 'ecosystem'. An ecosystem can be thought of as a community of living things and their physical environment. The community of living things includes plants, animals, and microorganisms. The physical environment includes the air, water, soil, and climate. Ecosystems vary in size from a single tree to an entire rainforest.	ecosystem	Using an analogy, explain ecosystem to a social science student.
An ecosystem can be thought of as a community of different species that interact with each other and their environment. The relationships between the species in an ecosystem are important, because they determine how the ecosystem functions. For example, if one species is removed from an ecosystem, it can have a ripple effect on the rest of the organisms in the community.	ecosystem	Using an analogy, explain ecosystem to a social science student.
Ecosystems are like large social groups. Just as a group of people has many different parts (e.g., the elderly, children, parents), an ecosystem has many different parts (plants, animals, bacteria). Each part of the ecosystem plays an important role in keeping the system functioning. For example, if there were no plants to convert sunlight into energy, then there would be no food for the animals.	ecosystem	Using an analogy, explain ecosystem to a social science student.
An action potential is a lot like an avalanche. It starts with a tiny bit of snow at the top of the mountain and builds as it travels down, picking up speed and power along the way. An action potential starts with a neurotransmitter molecule being released from one neuron and hitting a receptor on another. This causes Na+ ions to flood into the second neuron, which in turn causes even more molecules of neurotransmitter to be released. This triggers yet more Na+ ions to flood in, and so on, until finally enough voltage has built up that an electrical impulse fires down the neuron, carrying the signal on to its target.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Using an analogy, explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron to a social science student.
When an action potential is generated by the dendrite of a neuron, it travels down the axon to the terminal buttons. When it reaches the terminal buttons, neurotransmitters are released into the synapse and diffuse across to the next neuron. This process continues until the message reaches its target, such as a muscle or gland cell.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Using an analogy, explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron to a social science student.
A social science student may think of an action potential traveling down a neuron as similar to the spreading of news or rumors through a community.just as rumors tend to grow and change as they spread, so too does the strength (amplitude) of an action potential increase as it travels down a neuron.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Using an analogy, explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron to a social science student.
Breathing mechanism of frogs can be explained using an analogy of a bellows. The lungs (thoracic cavity) act like the two sides of a bellows, alternately expanding and contracting to draw air in and push it out. The air is drawn in through the nostrils and pushed out through the mouth. Frogs also have a small hole (the glottis) between the vocal chords that can be closed off to keep water from entering their lungs when they are underwater.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Using an analogy, explain breathing mechanism of frogs to a social science student.
Breathing mechanism of frogs can be explained using an analogy of a car. Like a car, the frog's body has an engine (heart), fuel (blood) and exhaust system (lungs). The heart pumps blood throughout the body. The blood carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. carbon dioxide, a waste product produced by cells, is carried from other parts of the body back to the lungs, where it is exhaled.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Using an analogy, explain breathing mechanism of frogs to a social science student.
Breathing mechanism of frogs can be explained as the process of inhaling and exhaling air to exchange oxygen for carbon dioxide. This is done by the frog's lungs, which are located in its chest cavity. When the frog inhales, it brings fresh air into its lungs. The air passes through tiny blood vessels called capillaries, where the oxygen is released from the air and exchanged for carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide then travels back through other blood vessels to the frog's stomach, where it is expelled during exhalation.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Using an analogy, explain breathing mechanism of frogs to a social science student.
Layered architecture is similar to the hierarchy of a social institution, such as a school. The top layer is the board of directors or principal who sets the overall policy and direction for the organization. The next layer down are the administrators who carry out the policies set by the board and manage specific areas of operation. Below them are the teachers who educate students, and finally, at the bottom of the pyramid are the students themselves. Each layer relies on those below it to do their job effectively in order to achieve success for all.	layered architecture	Using an analogy, explain layered architecture to a social science student.
A layered architecture is like a cake. It has different layers, with each layer having a specific purpose. The bottom layer is the foundation, and it supports the rest of the cake. The next layer is the crust, which gives the cake structure and protects it from becoming soggy. Next are the filling and toppings, which add flavor and sweetness to the cake. Finally, there is the frosting on top, which makes it look pretty and finished.	layered architecture	Using an analogy, explain layered architecture to a social science student.
Layered architecture is a way of organizing computer systems so that programs and data are isolated from each other. This makes it easier to change or update one part of the system without affecting the others. It also makes it easier to protect sensitive data, since unauthorized users can be limited to accessing only certain parts of the system.	layered architecture	Using an analogy, explain layered architecture to a social science student.
A limiting reactant is a substance that limits the amount of product that can be formed from a chemical reaction. The excess reactant is the remainder of the chemicals after the limiting reactant has been used up.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Using an analogy, explain limiting reactant and excess reactant to a social science student.

The excess reactant is thereactant that's left over after the limiting reactant is gone.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Using an analogy, explain limiting reactant and excess reactant to a social science student.
A social science student may not be familiar with the term "eukaryotic cell." A eukaryotic cell is a type of cell in a living organism. It is distinguished from other types of cells by its size and complexity. Eukaryotic cells are typically much larger than prokaryotic cells (the other major type of cell), and they possess a number of internal organelles that prokaryotic cells lack, such as the nucleus, which contains the organism's genetic material.	eukaryotic cell	Using an analogy, explain eukaryotic cell to a social science student.

Prokaryotic cells also communicate with one another and cooperate to achieve common goals (such as reproduction).	prokaryotic cell	Using an analogy, explain prokaryotic cell to a social science student.
A prokaryotic cell can be seen as a basic, individual unit of life. It is relatively simple in structure and function when compared to more complex cells, such as those found in animals and plants. Prokaryotic cells do not have a defined nucleus or other specialized organelles; their genetic material is dispersed throughout the cell cytoplasm. They are also generally smaller than eukaryotic cells. In social science terms, prokaryotic cells might be thought of as equivalent to individuals in a population—simple, undifferentiated units that make up the whole.	prokaryotic cell	Using an analogy, explain prokaryotic cell to a social science student.

One way to think of ANOVA is as a giant t-test. The null hypothesis in an ANOVA is that the means of all the groups are equal. If this null hypothesis is rejected, then we can conclude that there is a difference between at least two of the groups.	anova	Using an analogy, explain anova to a social science student.
One of the most common ways to analyze variance in data is with ANOVA, or Analysis of Variance. This technique can be used when you have two (or more) groups of data that you want to compare. For example, let's say you wanted to know if there was a difference in test scores between boys and girls. You would gather data from a bunch of students, divide them into two groups (boys and girls), and then compare their test scores. ANOVA allows you to do this comparison in a statistically rigorous way.	anova	Using an analogy, explain anova to a social science student.

Chemical equilibrium is a state in which the rates of forward and reverse reactions are equal. This means that the concentrations of reactants and products do not change with time. In order to achieve chemical equilibrium, the reaction must be reversible (i.e., have an equilibrium constant).	chemical equilibrium	Using an analogy, explain chemical equilibrium to a social science student.
Chemical equilibrium is like a seesaw. On one side of the seesaw, there are more reactants (chemical substances that start a reaction). On the other side of the seesaw, there are more products (chemicals that are produced by a reaction). The two sides stay in balance because as one side gets bigger, the other gets smaller.	chemical equilibrium	Using an analogy, explain chemical equilibrium to a social science student.

Suppose you are a cook in a busy restaurant. You need to have all the ingredients for your recipes on hand, but you don't want to have too many ingredients sitting around unused in the kitchen. So you order only what you need from a supplier just before you need it. That's how just-in-time works: goods are ordered and delivered only when they are needed, so there is no waste.	just-in-time	Using an analogy, explain just-in-time to a social science student.
Just-in-time is a manufacturing strategy that aims to reduce waste by producing only what is needed, when it is needed. This approach requires close cooperation between suppliers and manufacturers.	just-in-time	Using an analogy, explain just-in-time to a social science student.
Adaptive immunity can be thought of as an auto-immune response gone haywire. In a healthy individual, adaptive immunity protects the body from pathogens by recognizing specific pieces of protein on the surface of the pathogen (antigens). The immune system produces antibodies that latch onto these antigens, which in turn flags the pathogen for destruction by other elements of the immune system. If a person's adaptive immunity is functioning properly, they will develop immunity to that particular pathogen and future exposure to it will not cause illness. However, if someone's adaptive immunity malfunctions, their body may produce antibodies that mistakenly recognize self-proteins as foreign antigens and attack them accordingly. This is what happens in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis.	adaptive immunity	Using an analogy, explain adaptive immunity to a social science student.
Social science students may not be familiar with the immune system, so an analogy could help explain it. The immune system is like a army that fights off invaders such as bacteria and viruses. It can adapt over time to better fight these invaders. This is similar to how social science students learn and adapt over time to better understand social phenomena.	adaptive immunity	Using an analogy, explain adaptive immunity to a social science student.
Adaptive immunity can be thought of as a bouncer at a club. The bouncer is constantly watching the door and when someone tries to come into the club they check to see if that person is allowed in. If they are not allowed in, then the bouncer will not let them in. This is similar to adaptive immunity because it is constantly monitoring for threats and when it finds a threat it will attack it.	adaptive immunity	Using an analogy, explain adaptive immunity to a social science student.
Ohm's law can be thought of as a relationship between electric current, voltage, and resistance. It states that the current through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference (voltage) across it, and inversely proportional to its resistance. In other words, if you increase the voltage or decrease the resistance, the current increases; if you decrease the voltage or increase the resistance, then the current decreases.	ohm's law	Using an analogy, explain ohm's law to a social science student.
Just as a garden hose can flow more water when the nozzle is opened wider, an electric current flows more freely through a metal wire when the voltage (pressure) is increased. Ohm's law states that this relationship between voltage and current is constant, so that if the voltage across a resistor doubles, the current through it also doubles.	ohm's law	Using an analogy, explain ohm's law to a social science student.
Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across the conductor. In other words, if you increase the voltage, the current will also increase. This law is important because it allows us to calculate how much current will flow through a circuit given a certain voltage.	ohm's law	Using an analogy, explain ohm's law to a social science student.
Transcription is the process of converting genetic information from DNA to RNA. This occurs in the nucleus of a cell and is necessary for protein synthesis.	transcription	Using an analogy, explain transcription to a social science student.
Transcription can be thought of as a stenographer taking dictation. The DNA sequence is the speaker, and the RNA transcript is the written record of what was said.	transcription	Using an analogy, explain transcription to a social science student.
Transcription is like taking dictation. The person giving the dictation (the transcriptionist) speaks into a machine, and the machine types out what they say.	transcription	Using an analogy, explain transcription to a social science student.
RNA polymerase is similar to a social science student in that it is responsible for reading and understanding the genetic instructions (gene) within a cell's DNA, and then uses these instructions to create a corresponding strand of RNA.	rna polymerase	Using an analogy, explain rna polymerase to a social science student.
RNA polymerase is a bit like a social media platform. Just as people use different platforms to share different types of information (text, photos, videos, etc.), RNA polymerases use different enzymes to create different types of RNA molecules (mRNAs, tRNAs, rRNAs, etc.).	rna polymerase	Using an analogy, explain rna polymerase to a social science student.
RNA polymerase can be thought of as the “glue” that holds DNA together and helps to create new cells. It is a complex enzyme that plays a critical role in gene expression—the process by which genetic information within DNA is used to produce proteins. RNA polymerase attaches to specific locations on the DNA molecule and begins reading the sequence of nucleotides (building blocks of DNA). It then uses this information to create a strand of RNA, which will eventually be translated into a protein.	rna polymerase	Using an analogy, explain rna polymerase to a social science student.
Ribosomes are small, spherical particles found in all cells. They are responsible for the production of proteins, which play a vital role in almost all biological processes. Like social science students, ribosomes need to be fed with information in order to do their job properly. In the case of ribosomes, this information comes from DNA molecules.	ribosome	Using an analogy, explain ribosome to a social science student.
Ribosomes are like the factories in a city. They make all of the proteins that are necessary for life. The proteins are like the products that are made in a factory.	ribosome	Using an analogy, explain ribosome to a social science student.
Ribosomes are like the factories of the cell. They make all of the proteins that the cell needs to function.	ribosome	Using an analogy, explain ribosome to a social science student.
In the context of social science, activator protein could be seen as a catalyst for change. For example, an activator protein might be responsible for setting in motion a series of events that eventually leads to a particular outcome - such as political reform.	activator protein	Using an analogy, explain activator protein to a social science student.
Activator protein is a molecule that helps to turn on genes. It is like a key that unlocks the door to the gene so that it can start working.	activator protein	Using an analogy, explain activator protein to a social science student.
Activator protein is a term used in biology to describe a type of protein that assists in the activation of other proteins. In social science, an activator might be thought of as someone who helps get things started or moving.	activator protein	Using an analogy, explain activator protein to a social science student.
An electric circuit is like a water pump. The pump has a tank of water and a pipe that goes from the tank to the faucet. When you turn on the faucet, water starts flowing out of the spout. The faster you turn on the faucet, the more water comes out. Electric circuits work in a similar way. They have a battery (the tank of water), wires (the pipes), and something called an "amplifier" (the faucet). When you turn on the amplifier, electricity starts flowing through the wires. The more electricity that flows, the brighter the light bulb gets or the louder the radio gets.	electric circuit	Using an analogy, explain electric circuit to a social science student.
An electric circuit is like a group of people who are all connected by lines. Each person can talk to each other, and they can all work together to create something amazing.	electric circuit	Using an analogy, explain electric circuit to a social science student.
Electricity is like water flowing through a pipe. In an electric circuit, the electricity flows from the battery (or power source), through the wires, and to the light bulb or other device. The current (the flow of electricity) is measured in amps.	electric circuit	Using an analogy, explain electric circuit to a social science student.
The hydrophobic effect is the tendency of nonpolar molecules to aggregate in an aqueous environment. This occurs because the polar water molecules are attracted to each other and surround the nonpolar molecules, pushing them away from one another.	hydrophobic effect	Using an analogy, explain hydrophobic effect to a social science student.
The hydrophobic effect can be thought of as an invisible force that causes water molecules to group together, repelling other molecules. This is why oil and water do not mix – the oil repels the water. The hydrophobic effect is responsible for the shape of proteins and DNA, which are both made up of long chains of amino acids that fold up into specific shapes.	hydrophobic effect	Using an analogy, explain hydrophobic effect to a social science student.
The hydrophobic effect is the tendency of nonpolar molecules to aggregate in an aqueous environment. This occurs because the polar water molecules interact more strongly with one another than with the nonpolar molecule, pushing it away from the center of the cluster.	hydrophobic effect	Using an analogy, explain hydrophobic effect to a social science student.
Biological signal transduction is like a telephone. The phone line transmits an electronic signal from one person to another. The signal passes through the wires in the phone line and is turned into sound waves that the recipient can hear on the other end of the line. Biological signals also transmit information between cells. The cell membrane acts as a telephone line, transmitting an electrical signal from one cell to another. The signal passes through the membrane and turns into a chemical message that tells the receiving cell what to do.	biological signal transduction	Using an analogy, explain biological signal transduction to a social science student.
Biological signal transduction can be thought of as the process by which a biological stimulus is converted into a cellular response. In other words, it is the way in which cells receive and interpret signals from their environment. This process involves a series of steps that begins with the binding of a ligand (a molecule that interacts with another molecule) to its receptor on the cell surface. This interaction triggers a change in the receptor's conformation, which leads to the activation of downstream molecules called second messengers. These second messengers then relay information about the original stimulus to the interior of the cell, where it initiates a response.	biological signal transduction	Using an analogy, explain biological signal transduction to a social science student.
Biological signal transduction can be thought of as a process similar to the way in which a telephone works. The telephone converts sound waves into electrical signals that are then transmitted over wires to another phone, where they are converted back into sound. In the same way, biological signal transduction uses proteins called receptors to convert chemical signals (such as hormones) into electrical signals that can be used by the cell.	biological signal transduction	Using an analogy, explain biological signal transduction to a social science student.
