RNA polymerase is like a secretary. It takes dictation from a boss (the DNA) and produces a typed copy (the RNA).	rna polymerase	Using an analogy, explain rna polymerase to a social science student.
Ribosomes are like the factories of the cell. They produce all of the proteins that the cell needs to function.	ribosome	Using an analogy, explain ribosome to a social science student.
Activator protein is like a key that unlocks the door to a room. The activator protein binds to a specific site on the DNA molecule and then recruits other proteins that help to open the door.	activator protein	Using an analogy, explain activator protein to a social science student.
An electric circuit is like a group of people who are all connected to each other. If one person in the group talks, the whole group hears them. If one person in the group turns on a light, the whole group sees the light.	electric circuit	Using an analogy, explain electric circuit to a social science student.
The hydrophobic effect is the tendency of nonpolar molecules to aggregate in an aqueous environment. This is because the polar water molecules interact more strongly with one another than with the nonpolar molecules. This interaction causes the nonpolar molecules to be pushed to the periphery of the water droplet, where they are less likely to interact with the water.	hydrophobic effect	Using an analogy, explain hydrophobic effect to a social science student.
Biological signal transduction can be thought of as a social science student trying to understand a foreign language. The student is trying to understand the meaning of the words and how they are used in conversation. In the same way, biological signal transduction is the process of understanding the meaning of the signals that are being sent and received by the cells in the body.	biological signal transduction	Using an analogy, explain biological signal transduction to a social science student.
