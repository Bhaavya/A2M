A good analogy to explain a cell to an arts student would be to compare it to a theater. Just as the theater has different sections (orchestra, balcony, etc.), each with its own purpose and function, so too does a cell have different parts that work together for a common goal. The stage is where the action happens and the audience watches from their seats; in the same way, the nucleus of the cell is where all of the important genetic information is located and cytoplasm surrounds it like an audience surrounding the stage. This analogy can help arts students understand how cells work together to create tissues, organs, and whole organisms.	cell	What is a good analogy to explain cell to an arts student?

A cell can be thought of as a tiny city. It has workers, traders, managers and even a mayor. The workers are the cells that do all the hard work - they produce energy, get rid of waste and fight off infection. The traders are the cells that pass messages around the city; telling the workers what to do and when to do it. The managers keep everything ticking over smoothly; making sure there is enough food and water for everyone and that trash is collected on time! And finally, the mayor ensures that everyone lives in harmony and follows the city's laws.	cells	What is a good analogy to explain cells to an arts student?
A cell membrane can be thought of as a border or fence around the cell. The job of the cell membrane is to control what goes in and out of the cell, while letting nutrients and other important things inside.

One good analogy to explain capacitance is that it is like a container of water. The more water there is in the container, the higher the level of water will be inside the container. In capacitance terms, this would mean that a capacitor with more electrons stored within it (higher capacitance) would have a higher voltage than one with fewer electrons stored (lower capacitance).	capacitance	What is a good analogy to explain capacitance to an arts student?
A capacitor is like a container of water. The more water you put in the container, the higher the pressure will be inside the container. A capacitor is also like a balloon. If you blow up a balloon and then let go of it, the air inside rushes out because there is now more space inside the balloon than outside. In both cases, we are talking about an increase in pressure or an increase in space.	capacitance	What is a good analogy to explain capacitance to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain capacitance is to think of it as a bucket. If you have a lot of water in the bucket, it will be heavy and take more effort to lift than if the bucket is empty.

Kirchoff's voltage law is a bit like the way water flows through a hose. The higher the pressure at one end of the hose, the more quickly the water will flow through it. In electrical circuits, the voltage (or pressure) is what causes currents to flow. So, in general, if you have a high voltage at one point in a circuit, that current will be strong and fast-moving. If you have low voltage, on the other hand, the current will be weaker and move more slowly.	kirchoff's voltage law	What is a good analogy to explain kirchoff's voltage law to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain Kirchhoff's voltage law to an arts student is the way in which a group of people interact in a social setting. Just as each person in a group has an effect on every other person, each component in an electrical circuit affects every other component.	kirchoff's voltage law	What is a good analogy to explain kirchoff's voltage law to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain Kirchhoff's voltage law to an arts student is that of a group of people in a room. If one person stands up and walks around the room, they will generate a Voltage (V) difference between their head and feet. This voltage will be equal at all points around the room. If another person now stands up, they will create their own voltage difference, which will add on to the first person's. If someone else then stands up, their voltage difference will be added on to the other two people's. And so on... The total sum of all these voltages around the room will always be equal to zero.	kirchoff's voltage law	What is a good analogy to explain kirchoff's voltage law to an arts student?

One analogy to explain the human active memory system is that it is similar to a computer. Our brain is constantly storing information, like a computer does, and we can access this information whenever we need it by recalling past experiences or using our senses. Just as a computer has different programs that allow us to do different things, our memories are divided into categories based on what type of information they contain (e.g., visual images, sounds, smells). We can also use memory aids, such as prompts or mnemonic devices, to help us remember information more easily.	human active memory system	What is a good analogy to explain human active memory system to an arts student?
One analogy to explain the human active memory system is that it is like a computer. The brain processes information and stores it in the short-term memory, which can hold about seven pieces of information for a few seconds. If the person does not need the information any longer, it will be forgotten. However, if the person needs to remember the information, then it will be transferred to long-term memory where it can be stored for an indefinite amount of time.	human active memory system	What is a good analogy to explain human active memory system to an arts student?
A human active memory system can be analogized to a desktop computer. The brain is like the computer's central processing unit, or CPU.

A good analogy to explain the rate-determining step of a reaction to an arts student is by using a comparison to traffic. The rate-determining step would be like the stoplight at an intersection that controls the flow of traffic. If the light is green, then cars can move through quickly. However, if the light turns red, then cars have to come to a stop and wait for it to turn back green before they can continue moving. In the same way, the rate-determining step is what determines how quickly a reaction takes place and how much product is produced.	rate-determining step of a reaction	What is a good analogy to explain rate-determining step of a reaction to an arts student?
One analogy that may help to explain a rate-determining step of a reaction is by using the example of two people, one who is fit and one who is out of shape. The person who is in better shape will be able to run faster than the person who is out of shape. In this analogy, the fit person can be compared to the reactant that is in an activated state, while the out-of-shape person can be compared to the reactant that is not in an activated state. The rate-determining step would then be how fast the out-of-shape person can become fit.	rate-determining step of a reaction	What is a good analogy to explain rate-determining step of a reaction to an arts student?
It can be difficult to explain the rate-determining step of a reaction to an arts student, but here is one possible analogy. Imagine you are going on a road trip and have two different routes planned – one that takes six hours and one that takes ten hours. Obviously, the six-hour route is the faster option, because it is the rate-determining step. All other things being equal, taking the longer route will mean that you arrive later than if you had taken the shorter route. In terms of chemical reactions, this means that if there are multiple pathways for a molecule to react, but only one of those pathways is faster than the others, then that pathway will be the rate-determining step.	rate-determining step of a reaction	What is a good analogy to explain rate-determining step of a reaction to an arts student?
Column chromatography is similar to how an artist uses a canvas and paints. The artist starts with a blank canvas and creates a work of art by adding different colors.

Just as the artist can create many different paintings by using different colors, the scientist can create many different compounds by using different chemicals.	column chromatography	What is a good analogy to explain column chromatography to an arts student?
Column chromatography is often described as a "sieving" process. Just as a sieve can be used to separate different-sized grains of rice, the column in chromatography can be used to separate molecules based on their size and/or chemical properties. In both cases, the smaller objects travel more quickly through the spaces between the larger ones.	column chromatography	What is a good analogy to explain column chromatography to an arts student?
Column chromatography can be thought of as a giant sorting machine.

Dynamic chemical equilibrium can be thought of as similar to a set of scales. On one side of the scales there are more reactants, while on the other side there are more products. The scales will eventually reach equilibrium, where the two sides are equal in weight. In terms of dynamic chemical equilibrium, this means that the rate at which the reaction occurs is equal to the rate at which it reverses.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	What is a good analogy to explain dynamic chemical equilibrium to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain vacuum to an arts student would be to compare it to a balloon. When a balloon is filled with air, it becomes round and inflated. When the air is released from the balloon, the balloon becomes flat because the space inside of it has been decreased.

A good analogy to explain proto-oncogenes to an arts student would be to compare them to pieces of a puzzle. Proto-oncogenes are like the individual pieces of the puzzle, and when they are all put together correctly, they create a finished product (i.e., a normal cell).

A good analogy to explain resonance hybrid to an arts student is that of two people, each holding one end of a long stick. If the two people shake their sticks at the same time and in opposite directions, they will create waves that move up and down the length of the stick.

The quick wave will move up and down the stick faster than the slow wave, creating a resonance hybrid between them.	resonance hybrid	What is a good analogy to explain resonance hybrid to an arts student?
A wave mechanical model can be explained as a ripple in a pond. When you throw a rock into the center of a still pond, it creates waves that move outward until they hit the shoreline and dissipate.

A frog's breathing mechanism is similar to that of a human. The lungs in a frog are located along the sides of its body, and when the frog inhales, it draws air into its lungs through its nose. When the frog exhales, it pushes the air out of its lungs through its mouth.	breathing mechanism of frogs	What is a good analogy to explain breathing mechanism of frogs to an arts student?
A frog's breathing mechanism is similar to that of a human. Air enters the lungs, and oxygen from the air diffuses into the blood. Carbon dioxide from the blood then diffuses back into the air in order to be exhaled.	breathing mechanism of frogs	What is a good analogy to explain breathing mechanism of frogs to an arts student?
A frog's breathing mechanism can be compared to that of an engine. The frog's lungs are like the engine's cylinders, and the air they breathe in is like the fuel. Just as an engine needs oxygen to run, so do frogs need oxygen to breathe. Frogs also have a special valve called the glottis which opens and closes to let them breathe in and out.	breathing mechanism of frogs	What is a good analogy to explain breathing mechanism of frogs to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain layered architecture to an arts student is the way in which a painting is constructed. A painter will start with a blank canvas and add layers of paint, each one building on top of the previous layer. The end result is a completed work of art that has depth and complexity.In the same way, a layered architecture system starts with a basic foundation and builds on top of that foundation with additional layers. Each layer adds new functionality or features to the system. The end result is a more complex system that can handle more tasks and provides greater flexibility.	layered architecture	What is a good analogy to explain layered architecture to an arts student?

A good analogy to explain limiting reactant and excess reactant to an arts student would be to compare it to food. The amount of food a person eats is limited by the size of their stomach, while the amount of leftovers they have is determined by how much food was originally put on their plate. In the same way, a chemical reaction has a limited number of molecules that can participate in the reaction (the limiting reactant), while any leftover molecules after the reaction is complete are considered the excess reactant.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	What is a good analogy to explain limiting reactant and excess reactant to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain limiting reactant and excess reactant to an arts student would be like a recipe for a cake. The recipe calls for two cups of sugar, but if you only have one cup, then the sugar will be the limiting reactant. This means that once all of the sugar is used up, no more cakes can be made. If you have three cups of sugar though, then the extra cup will be the excess reactant.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	What is a good analogy to explain limiting reactant and excess reactant to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain limiting reactant and excess reactant to an arts student would be to imagine that they are chefs in a kitchen. The oven is the only source of heat, and the chefs have two pots of water - one big pot and one small pot. They want to cook two dishes - a big dish and a small dish. To cook the big dish, they put the large pot of water on the stovetop and turn on the oven. To cook the small dish, they put the small pot of water on the stovetop and turn on the oven. The oven can only provide so much heat, so eventually it will reach its limit; at that point, no more heat can be transferred from the oven to either pot of water, even though both pots are still sitting on top of the stove. The temperature inside each pot will then start increasing until it reaches equilibrium (the same temperature) - at which point both pots will have been cooked fully. In this analogy, "heat" is equivalent to energy or light; "stovetop" is equivalent to a reactor core; "oven" is equivalent to containment vessel; "pot" is equivalent to fuel rods; "water" is equivalent to nuclear fuel material).	limiting reactant and excess reactant	What is a good analogy to explain limiting reactant and excess reactant to an arts student?

A good analogy to explain limiting reactant to an arts student is comparing it to the amount of paint a painter has. The painter can use all of the paint to create one large painting, or spread it out over several smaller paintings. In the same way, if too much reactant is used in a chemical reaction, there may not be enough left over for the desired product. This is why it's important to know how much of each reactant is available so that the correct proportions can be used.	limiting reactant	What is a good analogy to explain limiting reactant to an arts student?

In a similar way, the process control block keeps track of all the different processes running on the computer and makes sure that they don't interfere with each other.	process control block	What is a good analogy to explain process control block to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain process control block to an arts student would be as follows: imagine that you are a chef in a kitchen. You have several pots of boiling water on the stove, each with its own lid. As long as the lid is on, the pot will continue to boil; if you take the lid off, however, the pot will eventually cool down. The same principle applies to processes running on a computer - as long as the process control block is active (i.e., the "lid" is still on), it will continue to run; if it's not active anymore, then it'll stop running.	process control block	What is a good analogy to explain process control block to an arts student?

One way to think of receptor sites is as locks on a door. The drug is the key, and it fits into the lock in a specific way. This analogy can help you understand how a drug can interact with a receptor site to produce its effects.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	What is a good analogy to explain interaction between drugs and receptor sites to an arts student?
A relationship between two drugs and their receptor sites can be best explained as a love story. Just like in any healthy relationship, both parties need to be compatible in order for things to work out satisfactorily. In the case of drug-receptor site interaction, this means that the drug needs to have a chemical makeup that is similar enough to the receptor site so that it can “fit” properly and produce the desired effect. If everything lines up correctly, then they both enjoy a harmonious alliance; but if there are any discrepancies, things can quickly go downhill.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	What is a good analogy to explain interaction between drugs and receptor sites to an arts student?
One analogy to explain receptor sites and drug interaction is that of a lock and key. The drug is the key, and the receptor site is the lock.

A ram is a good analogy to explain because it is an animal that has horns. Horns are typically found on animals that mate for life and the male uses them to fight off other males who are trying to take away his mate. This can be used to explain how the horns are related to art because when two artists fall in love with each other, they tend to fight off anyone who tries to come between them and their work.	ram	What is a good analogy to explain ram to an arts student?
Ramming is a technique used in shipbuilding whereby the lower part of the bow of one ship is forced into the upper part of another ship.

A tree's age calculation is like measuring the growth of a child over time. You can start by taking a picture at the beginning of the year and then measure how tall the child has grown in inches or feet.

By doing this every year, you would be able to track how old the tree is by its height.	tree's age calculation	What is a good analogy to explain tree's age calculation to an arts student?
When you look at a tree, you might think it is just the one big giant leafy organism next to your house. But if you could zoom in on a cross-section of the trunk, you would see that the tree is made up of many smaller individual parts - each with its own age. Just like when you cut an apple in half, there are seeds in the core that are older than the slices around them, so too is it with trees. The outer layer of wood may be several years old, while the innermost layers could be decades or even centuries old!	tree's age calculation	What is a good analogy to explain tree's age calculation to an arts student?

Glycolysis is one of the ways that cells produce this energy.	glycolysis	What is a good analogy to explain glycolysis to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain anti-stokes scattering to an arts student would be the reflection of light off a mirror. The light is incident on the mirror at some angle, and is reflected off the surface of the mirror in a direction that is perpendicular to the original incident direction. If there were no mirror, the light would continue traveling in its original direction. However, because of the presence of the mirror, some of the energy is reflected back in the opposite direction (away from the mirror). This phenomenon is known as reflection.	anti-stokes scattering	What is a good analogy to explain anti-stokes scattering to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain anti-stokes scattering to an arts student is the way that light reflects off of a mirror. When light reflects off of a mirror, it bounces in the opposite direction than it came from.

One possible analogy for anti-Stokes scattering might be the way in which a rock skipping across the surface of a pond creates tiny ripples that spread out from the point of impact. In much the same way, light waves can be scattered by obstacles in their path (such as particles or molecules in the air), causing them to fan out and become less intense. Anti-Stokes scattering refers to an effect whereby these scattered light waves are actually reinforced and intensified, as opposed to weakened, as they travel away from the obstacle. This occurs when the frequency of the light wave is such that it matches or "resonates" with the natural vibrational frequencies of the obstacle itself.	anti-stokes scattering	What is a good analogy to explain anti-stokes scattering to an arts student?
One analogy to explain stokes scattering to an arts student is that it is similar to the way sunlight scatters off of a diamond.

An enzyme is like a key that unlocks a door. The substrate (the thing the enzyme is unlocking) is like the lock on the door, and the active site of the enzyme is like the keyhole. When you put the key in, it turns and opens up the lock.	enzyme mechanism	What is a good analogy to explain enzyme mechanism to an arts student?
Enzymes are like tiny machines that help chemical reactions happen. They work by fitting into the spaces on the molecules they interact with, and then using their energy to change the shape of those molecules. This makes it easier for other chemicals to join in and create a reaction. Think of it like a group of people trying to push a car out of the mud. With enough people pushing, the car will eventually move. But if one or two people try to push it alone, they will get tired quickly and not be able to move the car very far.	enzyme mechanism	What is a good analogy to explain enzyme mechanism to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain anova to an arts student would be to say that it is similar to the way a judge decides who wins a singing competition.

An anova is a statistical test that compares the means of three or more groups. It can be thought of as an X-ray machine that takes pictures of differences in bone density.	anova	What is a good analogy to explain anova to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain anova to an arts student would be to compare it to a tasting menu at a restaurant. The different courses offered on the menu represent the different tests that are being run (anova).

A good analogy to explain chemical equilibrium would be the example of a see-saw. If there is an equal amount of people on each side of the see-saw, it will be in balance. However, if one person gets off the see-saw, then it will imbalance and one side will go down. The same thing happens with chemical reactions; if there is an equal amount of reactants and products, then the reaction is in equilibrium. But, if something happens to change this balance (such as adding more or less reactants), then the reaction shifts until it reaches another equilibrium point.	chemical equilibrium	What is a good analogy to explain chemical equilibrium to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain chemical equilibrium is the concept of balance in a scale. When two objects are placed on either side of a scale, the balance tips until each object has an equal weight.

A good analogy to explain just-in-time to an arts student is that it is like having a closet full of clothes and only taking out the clothes you need for each day. You are not wasting time or money by buying clothes that you will never wear.	just-in-time	What is a good analogy to explain just-in-time to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain just-in-time manufacturing would be to imagine a production line for making candy bars. In the traditional model, an assembly line would produce candy bars at set intervals, regardless of how many orders have been placed. With just-in-time manufacturing, however, the factory would only produce as many candy bars as are needed at any given time. This would allow them to respond more quickly to changes in demand and avoid wasting resources on producing excess inventory.	just-in-time	What is a good analogy to explain just-in-time to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain just-in-time manufacturing to an arts student would be the process of making a movie. Typically, a movie is shot over the course of several weeks, with many scenes being filmed simultaneously. However, the scenes are not edited together until shortly before the film is released. This allows for last-minute changes (e.g., adjusting dialogue or adding new effects) without having to go back and reshoot entire sections of the movie. In much the same way, just-in-time manufacturing relies on suppliers delivering components "just in time" for assembly into a final product.	just-in-time	What is a good analogy to explain just-in-time to an arts student?
Adaptive immunity can be thought of as an immune system that "learns" after it is exposed to a pathogen. Just as a person's muscles get stronger after they exercise, the adaptive immune system gets better at fighting off pathogens after it has been exposed to them. This analogy might help students understand how the adaptive immune response works: Imagine you are in a martial arts class and your Sensei (teacher) tells you that you will now be learning self-defense techniques against an attacker who is wielding a knife. In order for you to learn how to defend yourself against this type of attack, your Sensei will have someone come into the dojo and attack you with a knife. You will then have the opportunity to practice defending yourself against this type of attack. After doing this several times, you will become better at defending yourself against someone who is attacking with a knife. The same thing happens with the adaptive immune response - by being exposed to different types of pathogens, our cells learn how best to fight them off.	adaptive immunity	What is a good analogy to explain adaptive immunity to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain adaptive immunity to an arts student would be to compare it to the immune system of a human body. The human immune system is constantly fighting off invading viruses, bacteria and other organisms. It does this by recognizing specific proteins on the surface of these organisms that are not found on healthy cells in the body. The human immune system produces antibodies that specifically recognize and bind to these foreign proteins. This can neutralize the invader or help destroy it. In a similar way, the adaptive immune system also recognizes specific proteins on invading pathogens. However, instead of producing antibodies, it produces T-cells and B-cells that specifically recognize these proteins. These cells then remember how to fight off that particular invader in future encounters.	adaptive immunity	What is a good analogy to explain adaptive immunity to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain adaptive immunity to an arts student would be that of a bouncer at a nightclub. The bouncer is constantly watching the door and assessing who should and should not be allowed into the club. If someone tries to push their way past the bouncer, they will likely be stopped. However, if someone is recognized as being a regular customer or if they have a friend who is already inside, then the bouncer will likely let them in without any trouble. In much the same way, our immune system is always on guard against potential threats. If something unfamiliar comes along, our immune system will respond by attacking it. However, if we are exposed to something more often (like a cold virus), then our immune system will eventually learn to recognize it and stop attacking it so aggressively.	adaptive immunity	What is a good analogy to explain adaptive immunity to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain Ohm's law to an arts student is that of a water hose. When the water pressure is high, more water comes out of the hose. Similarly, when the voltage is high, more current flows through the wire.	ohm's law	What is a good analogy to explain ohm's law to an arts student?
Ohm's law is similar to the water pressure in a hose. The more water that is flowing through the hose (current), the higher the pressure at the nozzle. Similarly, with an electric current, the more electrons that are flowing, the greater the voltage.	ohm's law	What is a good analogy to explain ohm's law to an arts student?
A musician follows a score to create music. An ohm's law analogy could be that an electric current is like musical notes, and the resistor is like a musician who follows the notes to play their instrument.	ohm's law	What is a good analogy to explain ohm's law to an arts student?
One way to think of transcription is as a "mirror" process, in which the genetic information in DNA is copied and then used to create proteins. Just as you might see your reflection in a mirror, the genetic instructions in DNA are "read" by enzymes and used to produce a new molecule called RNA (ribonucleic acid). RNA can then be used by cells to make proteins.	transcription	What is a good analogy to explain transcription to an arts student?
Transcription is a bit like taking dictation. You are listening to someone speak and writing down what they say word for word.	transcription	What is a good analogy to explain transcription to an arts student?

A good analogy to explain RNA polymerase to an arts student would be to say that it is a bit like a typewriter. Just as a typewriter uses letters to create words, RNA polymerase uses nucleotides (the building blocks of DNA) to create strands of RNA.	rna polymerase	What is a good analogy to explain rna polymerase to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain RNA polymerase to an arts student would be to say that it is the “glue” that holds together the genetic material of a cell.	rna polymerase	What is a good analogy to explain rna polymerase to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain RNA polymerase to an arts student would be to say that it is like a typewriter. Just as the typewriter prints letters one at a time, RNA polymerase assembles individual nucleotides into a strand of RNA.	rna polymerase	What is a good analogy to explain rna polymerase to an arts student?
A ribosome is like a construction worker. It takes the blueprints from the engineer (mRNA) and builds the house using the materials it is given (amino acids).	ribosome	What is a good analogy to explain ribosome to an arts student?
A good analogy for ribosomes to an arts student would be that they are the "workers" in the cell. Just as a construction crew is responsible for building a house, ribosomes are responsible for building proteins.	ribosome	What is a good analogy to explain ribosome to an arts student?
A ribosome is like a construction worker who reads the blueprint for a building and then assembles the building using the pieces that are provided.	ribosome	What is a good analogy to explain ribosome to an arts student?
If activator protein is the director of a play, then the DNA is the script. The activator protein tells the genes what to do and when to do it.	activator protein	What is a good analogy to explain activator protein to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain activator protein to an arts student is that it is like a key that unlocks the door to DNA. The activator protein binds to specific sections of DNA, and then recruits other proteins that help to turn on or activate the genes located in that section.	activator protein	What is a good analogy to explain activator protein to an arts student?
An activator protein is like a key that unlocks the door to a room. The activator protein binds to certain molecules in the cell, which then activates other proteins that cause the cell to change or grow.	activator protein	What is a good analogy to explain activator protein to an arts student?
Electricity is like water in a pipe. The voltage is the pressure of the electricity, measured in volts. The current is the volume of electricity, measured in amps. Resistance is like a narrowing in the pipe, slowing down the water (electricity).	electric circuit	What is a good analogy to explain electric circuit to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain electric circuits to an arts student might be to compare it to a group of people who are all linked together by rope. Each person in the group is holding one end of the rope and, as a result, every other person in the group is affected by their movements. In much the same way, each component in an electric circuit affects every other component in the circuit.	electric circuit	What is a good analogy to explain electric circuit to an arts student?
Electricity is like water in a hose. The more water pressure you have, the farther the water will go. Voltage (pressure) in an electric circuit makes electrons flow through the wire just like water flows through a hose when you turn on the faucet.	electric circuit	What is a good analogy to explain electric circuit to an arts student?
Water droplets will bead up and roll off a hydrophobic surface, such as wax. This is because the water molecules are attracted to each other more than they are attracted to the hydrophobic material.	hydrophobic effect	What is a good analogy to explain hydrophobic effect to an arts student?
Water molecules are polar, meaning that the oxygen atom has a partial negative charge and the hydrogen atoms have a partial positive charge. Nonpolar molecules lack this polarity. In general, water molecules are attracted to one another (due to their polarity) and are repelled by nonpolar molecules. This is why oil and water do not mix: Oil is made up of many nonpolar molecules, so it is not attracted to the polar water molecules.	hydrophobic effect	What is a good analogy to explain hydrophobic effect to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain hydrophobic effect to an arts student would be that of two magnets. If you have ever played with two magnets, you will know that when they are close to each other, the north poles will align and the south pole of one magnet will attract the north pole of the other. This is because opposite poles attract each other. In a similar way, water molecules are attracted to each other due to their polarity - the oxygen atom in a water molecule has a negative charge and the hydrogen atoms have a positive charge. However, water molecules are also repelled by each other due to their hydrophobic (water-hating) elements.	hydrophobic effect	What is a good analogy to explain hydrophobic effect to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain biological signal transduction to an arts student is the act of turning a light switch on and off. When you flip the switch, electricity flows from the power source to the lightbulb, and the light turns on. In a similar way, when a hormone or other molecule sends a signal into a cell, it triggers a chain of reactions that eventually causes the cellular machinery to change its behavior.	biological signal transduction	What is a good analogy to explain biological signal transduction to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain biological signal transduction to an arts student would be a theatrical performance. In both cases, there is a message that is being transmitted from one person (or group of people) to another. The performer is like the molecule sending the signal, while the audience is like the cells receiving it. Just as in real life, things can go wrong during a theatrical performance if someone misses their cue or gets out of sync with everyone else. This can be analogous to something going wrong during a biological process if one of the molecules involved in signaling doesn't respond properly.	biological signal transduction	What is a good analogy to explain biological signal transduction to an arts student?
A good analogy to explain biological signal transduction to an arts student would be the way a musician uses different instruments to create a symphony. Just as each instrument in a band has its own unique sound, cells use different proteins (molecules that conduct signals) to relay messages and carry out specific functions. Like a conductor who assembles musicians to create a masterpiece, hormones and other signaling molecules orchestrate the activities of cells by activating or inhibiting the proteins they need to do their jobs.	biological signal transduction	What is a good analogy to explain biological signal transduction to an arts student?
