A ribosome can be thought of as a business factory. The ribosomes are responsible for reading the instructions in a gene and then assembling the corresponding protein. The proteins produced in the ribosomes are then used by the cell to carry out its functions.	ribosome	What is a good analogy to explain ribosome to a business student?
An activator protein is like a key that unlocks a door. The activator protein binds to a specific site on the DNA molecule and then helps to open up the door so that the gene can be expressed.	activator protein	What is a good analogy to explain activator protein to a business student?
Electricity is like water in a pipe. The voltage is the water pressure, and the current is the amount of water flowing through the pipe.	electric circuit	What is a good analogy to explain electric circuit to a business student?
A good analogy to explain hydrophobic effect to a business student is to imagine that water is oil and vice versa. Just as oil and water do not mix, water and hydrophobic molecules do not mix. This is because water is polar and hydrophobic molecules are nonpolar.	hydrophobic effect	What is a good analogy to explain hydrophobic effect to a business student?
A good analogy to explain biological signal transduction to a business student would be to compare it to a company's stock market. Just as a company's stock price rises and falls based on how the market perceives its stock, a cell's signal transduction pathway is altered by the presence (or absence) of certain molecules. These molecules can be thought of as the company's stock, and the pathway is the market in which the stock is traded.	biological signal transduction	What is a good analogy to explain biological signal transduction to a business student?
