Just like those sound waves, electrical impulses also grow in strength as they travel down our nerves.	action potential	What is a good analogy to explain action potential to a social science student?
One way to think about chromatography is as though it is a kind of “sorting” process. When you put a piece of paper in a inkjet printer, the printhead sprays tiny droplets of ink onto the page. As the paper moves through the printer, the droplets dry and create an image on the page. If you look at a close-up view of an individual dot from an inkjet print, you can see that it is not just one color; instead, it is made up of many different colors mixed together. This is because when the droplets hit the paper they are not all traveling at exactly the same speed. Some will move faster than others, and this will cause them to spread out slightly on the page. The different colors in each dot will then dry at different speeds, creating a multicolored image.	experiment of chromatography	What is a good analogy to explain experiment of chromatography to a social science student?

A capacitor is a bit like a container of water. If you have a large container, it will take longer to fill up than if you have a small one. This is because there is more space for the water to flow into in the smaller container. A capacitor works in much the same way - it has an electrode on each side, and electrons can flow freely between them. The more surface area that is available, the more capacitance there will be.	capacitance	What is a good analogy to explain capacitance to a social science student?
A capacitor is like a bucket of water. If you fill the bucket with water and then touch the metal handle, you will get an electric shock. The shock is because of the capacitance of the water in the bucket.	capacitance	What is a good analogy to explain capacitance to a social science student?
A capacitance is a measure of the ability of an electric field to store energy in an electric potential. A capacitor is constructed of two metal plates separated by a dielectric material.

A current of electricity is a lot like a flow of water. Just as the amount of water in a river can vary depending on how much it has rained, the strength (or voltage) of an electric current can vary depending on how much power is supplied to it. Just as a dam can be used to control the flow of water in a river, so too can resistors and other electronic components be used to control the flow of electricity in circuits.

A kirchoff's voltage law analogy for a social science student would be to think of the electric company as a big, complex machine. This machine has many parts - including wires, transformers, and generators - that all work together to create electricity. Just like with any other machine, if one part of the electric company is not working properly, it can affect the entire system.	kirchoff's voltage law	What is a good analogy to explain kirchoff's voltage law to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain Kirchoff's voltage law to a social science student is as follows: imagine you are at a party with a bunch of friends. You are all talking and having a great time together. Suddenly, someone turns on the music really loud. What happens? The conversation becomes louder and more animated in order to compete with the noise from the music. In much the same way, electric current (the flow of electrons) creates a "noise" that needs to be overcome if it is going to affect an electrical circuit (like your conversation at the party). This "noise" is known as voltage, and Kirchoff's Voltage Law states that it must always add up to zero.	kirchoff's voltage law	What is a good analogy to explain kirchoff's voltage law to a social science student?
A good analogy for Kirchhoff's voltage law is the flow of traffic in a city. Just as cars need to follow certain rules (e.g., stop at red lights, yield to oncoming traffic) in order to keep the flow of traffic moving smoothly, electrical current also needs to abide by certain rules in order to avoid creating chaos. One of these rules is Kirchhoff's voltage law, which states that the sum of all voltages around a closed loop must be zero.	kirchoff's voltage law	What is a good analogy to explain kirchoff's voltage law to a social science student?

The people are close together at the beginning and end of the wave, but there is more space between them as they move through the middle.	nature of a density wave	What is a good analogy to explain nature of a density wave to a social science student?
One way to think about a density wave is as if it's an energetic tsunami moving through a population. Just as the wave crest moves fastest and the trough lags behind, so too does the peak in births (or any other measure of "energy") precede the low point. As people move out of one age group and into another, they carry with them some of the earlier group's energy, creating bumps and dips along the way.	nature of a density wave	What is a good analogy to explain nature of a density wave to a social science student?
A density wave can be thought of as a pulse that travels through a population.

The human active memory system can be best explained as an office space. The "office" is where all of the important information is stored and it is accessible to the individual whenever they need it. The "office" has many different folders, each containing specific types of information. To keep everything organized, the folders are labeled and sorted accordingly. In order to remember something, the individual must first store it in their "office." They can do this by either writing it down or by mentally committing it to memory. The next time they need to access that information, they simply have to go into their "office" and find the relevant folder.	human active memory system	What is a good analogy to explain human active memory system to a social science student?
A human's active memory system is like a computer. The RAM (random access memory) stores the information that is being actively used, while the hard drive holds all of the other information that has been stored. When you need to use some of the information from the hard drive, you can access it by loading it into RAM.	human active memory system	What is a good analogy to explain human active memory system to a social science student?
The human active memory system is like a computer. The computer has a hard drive, which is where all of the information is stored. The computer also has random access memory (RAM), which is where the information that you are working on currently is stored. When you need to access the information, your brain acts as the CPU and retrieves it from either the hard drive or RAM.	human active memory system	What is a good analogy to explain human active memory system to a social science student?
The rate-determining step of a reaction is the slowest step in a chemical reaction. This analogy might help explain it to a social science student: think about how quickly a conversation can move when everyone is on the same page, and compare that to how slowly a conversation can move when one person is talking and the other people are not paying attention. The rate-determining step would be like the people who are not paying attention in the conversation—they are slowing down the whole process.	rate-determining step of a reaction	What is a good analogy to explain rate-determining step of a reaction to a social science student?
One analogy to explain the rate-determining step of a reaction to a social science student is that it is like the slowest person in a race.

The rate-determining step of a reaction is the slowest step in a reaction. This analogy can be used to explain how different steps in a social science process can impact the speed of the overall process. For example, if you are trying to get from point A to point B as quickly as possible, but there is a lot of traffic at point C, you will likely have to take a longer route and spend more time traveling. In this analogy, Point A would represent the beginning of the social science process, Point B would represent the end of the process, and Point C would represent any obstacle or delay that slows down progress between Points A and B.	rate-determining step of a reaction	What is a good analogy to explain rate-determining step of a reaction to a social science student?
A column chromatography is like a grocery store. The different types of food (the different compounds) are lined up on the shelves and the customer can choose what they want to buy.	column chromatography	What is a good analogy to explain column chromatography to a social science student?
Column chromatography is like a maze. The solvent travels through the maze, and as it does so, it separates the different compounds in the sample. The compounds travel at different speeds through the maze, so they separate out into different bands (or "colums") as they move along.	column chromatography	What is a good analogy to explain column chromatography to a social science student?
Column chromatography is like a sorting machine. The different compounds in the mixture are sorted based on how they interact with the column. The most soluble compounds move through the column faster and are at the top of the column. The least soluble compounds move through the column slower and are at the bottom of the column.	column chromatography	What is a good analogy to explain column chromatography to a social science student?
The best analogy to explain dynamic chemical equilibrium is a party. Imagine that you have invited a lot of people to your house for a party and set out food and drinks. Initially, the food and drinks will be consumed at a rapid rate as everyone digs in. However, as more people arrive and the initial excitement wears off, people will start to eat and drink more slowly. The same thing happens with chemical reactions; when they are first started, the reaction occurs quickly as all of the reactants are used up. However, as time goes on and new reactants are introduced into the reaction mixture, the reaction slows down until it reaches equilibrium where the rates of formation and destruction of products are equal.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	What is a good analogy to explain dynamic chemical equilibrium to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain dynamic chemical equilibrium to a social science student would be to say that it is like two people pushing on a door. The first person pushes the door open, and the second person pushes it closed. The first person then tries to push it open again, but the second person keeps pushing back, so the door stays closed.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	What is a good analogy to explain dynamic chemical equilibrium to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain dynamic chemical equilibrium is the example of a basketball team. When one player throws the ball to another, it doesn't stay stationary in mid-air; rather, it moves continuously until one player catches it. In the same way, atoms and molecules are always moving around in a liquid or gas, even if they're at rest. If more molecules of one type are introduced into the system than there are of another type (for instance, if you put more oxygen gas into a container than nitrogen), then those molecules will start moving faster and pushing other molecules out of the way until an equilibrium is reached where every molecule has an equal chance of being in any given spot.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	What is a good analogy to explain dynamic chemical equilibrium to a social science student?
A vacuole is a storage space in a cell. It can be compared to a closet in a house. The closet is used for storing clothes, and the vacuole is used for storing other cell materials.	vacuole	What is a good analogy to explain vacuole to a social science student?

A proto-oncogene is like a tumor suppressor gene's "little brother." Just as a tumor suppressor gene helps keep tumors from developing, proto-oncogenes help keep cells in check, preventing them from becoming cancerous. But sometimes, through mutations or other changes, a proto-oncogene can become overactive and contribute to the development of cancer.	proto-oncogenes	What is a good analogy to explain proto-oncogenes to a social science student?
One analogy to explain proto-oncogenes to a social science student is that they are like traffic lights. They help control the flow of information and keep everything organized.

A good analogy to explain oncogenes to a social science student is that they are like traffic lights. They help control the flow of traffic and keep things moving smoothly. However, if there is a problem with the traffic light, it can cause chaos and gridlock. Oncogenes work in a similar way. They help regulate cell growth and prevent cancer from forming.

A good analogy to explain brittle software to a social science student is as follows: imagine that you have just created an incredibly intricate and delicate snowflake. Now, imagine that someone steps on it. The snowflake is now ruined – it’s no longer the beautiful creation that it once was. This is what happens with brittle software; a small change or problem can cause the entire system to break down.	brittle software	What is a good analogy to explain brittle software to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain brittle software to a social science student is that it can be seen as a toothpick. Toothpicks are fine when used for their intended purpose, but if too much weight is applied they will snap.

The dna molecule is placed on the template strand and it is replicated exactly.	dna replication	What is a good analogy to explain dna replication to a social science student?
One possible analogy to explain DNA replication to a social science student is as follows: Imagine that you have a book and you want to make an exact copy of it. To do so, you would need two things - the original book and some paper. You would begin by opening up the original book and copying down all of the text onto fresh pieces of paper. Once you have finished copying all of the text, you would then close up the original book and put it away somewhere safe. Finally, you would take your newly created copies of the book and give them to your friends or sell them in stores.

The document (rna molecule) is placed on the copier machine and a copy of it is made (rna transcript).	rna transcription	What is a good analogy to explain rna transcription to a social science student?
When a person speaks, the words that come out of their mouth are actually composed of smaller pieces called phonemes. Phonemes are made up of even smaller pieces called letters. Just as phonemes are composed of letters, genes are composed of nucleotides. Nucleotides make up the rna sequence which is transcribed from dna during gene transcription.	rna transcription	What is a good analogy to explain rna transcription to a social science student?
One analogy to explain RNA transcription to a social science student is that it is similar to taking a dictation. Just as the person taking the dictation repeats what they hear, the RNA polymerase reads and duplicates the genetic code from DNA.	rna transcription	What is a good analogy to explain rna transcription to a social science student?
An analogy to explain protein translation to a social science student is as follows: just as a recipe calls for specific ingredients that are combined in a certain way to create a desired outcome, the genetic code stored within DNA functions similarly by providing the instructions for creating proteins. The sequence of nucleotides within DNA is "read" and "translated" into an amino acid sequence during protein synthesis. Just as different combinations of spices can result in varied flavors in cooking, so too do different sequences of amino acids produce unique proteins with their own individual characteristics.	protein translation	What is a good analogy to explain protein translation to a social science student?
A protein translation analogy to a social science student could be likened to the process of making a new movie. The producer assembles a team of people who have different skills- scriptwriters, directors, actors, set builders, lighting technicians, and so on. These people then each do their job to create the individual scenes that will make up the finished product. Finally, all the scenes are put together and we have a movie! In much the same way, proteins are assembled from smaller molecules (amino acids) by ribosomes working together. Each amino acid has its own specific role in creating the final protein structure.	protein translation	What is a good analogy to explain protein translation to a social science student?
A protein is like a sentence in a foreign language. The sentence is made up of smaller parts (words), and to understand the sentence, you need to know what the words mean. In order to translate the sentence, you need a dictionary (a list of translations). To create the protein, your body needs an instruction manual (the genetic code) and all of the necessary tools (amino acids).	protein translation	What is a good analogy to explain protein translation to a social science student?
A human body is an analogy to explain ecosystem. The human body has different parts that all work together to keep the person alive and healthy- just like an ecosystem has different parts that all work together to keep the environment healthy.	ecosystem	What is a good analogy to explain ecosystem to a social science student?
A social science student might not be familiar with the term "ecosystem." A good analogy to explain ecosystem would be to say that it is like a human body. The human body has different parts that work together to keep the whole functioning. Likewise, an ecosystem has different parts (plants, animals, decomposers) that work together to keep the whole functioning.	ecosystem	What is a good analogy to explain ecosystem to a social science student?
One way to think of an ecosystem is as a human body. The environment is the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. The ecosystem includes all the plants, animals, and microorganisms in our surroundings. Just as our body needs oxygen, water, and food to survive, so does an ecosystem need clean air, fresh water, and healthy soil to thrive.	ecosystem	What is a good analogy to explain ecosystem to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron would be to compare it to a series of buckets linked together. Each time someone pulls the chain on one bucket, the water flows down to the next. In this analogy, the "water" is the action potential and each "bucket" is a segment of the neuron.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	What is a good analogy to explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron to a social science student is like water flowing through a hose. The action potential travels down the neuron much like the water flows through the hose, and when it reaches the end of the neuron it triggers the release of neurotransmitters which communicate with other neurons.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	What is a good analogy to explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron to a social science student is as follows: imagine a parade passing through the city. The first group of people are at the front of the parade and they start dancing and waving flags. As each person in this group starts dancing, they begin to move forward. This then causes the next group of people behind them to start dancing and moving forward, and so on until the entire parade has moved along. In a similar way, an action potential begins at the beginning (soma) of a neuron and travels down its axon until it reaches the end.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	What is a good analogy to explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron to a social science student?
A frog's breathing mechanism is similar to that of a human. The frog inhales and exhales air through its nose and mouth. Its lungs expand and contract as it breathes in and out. Frogs also have a system of small blood vessels called capillaries which allow them to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with their environment.	breathing mechanism of frogs	What is a good analogy to explain breathing mechanism of frogs to a social science student?
Breathing is similar to how a fan works. The fan has blades that spin and create a breeze. This breeze helps cool down the room. Frogs use their lungs like fans to help circulate air through their bodies.	breathing mechanism of frogs	What is a good analogy to explain breathing mechanism of frogs to a social science student?
A frog's breathing mechanism is similar to that of a human. The frog uses its lungs to breathe in and out just like humans do. However, frogs also have a mechanism called buccal pumping. Buccal pumping is when the frog sucks in air through its mouth and then forces it out through its nostrils. This extra mechanism allows the frog to get more oxygen into its system, which is especially important when the frog is underwater.	breathing mechanism of frogs	What is a good analogy to explain breathing mechanism of frogs to a social science student?

Just as each smaller doll fits inside the larger one, features at each level of an information system can be nested within those at the next higher level.	layered architecture	What is a good analogy to explain layered architecture to a social science student?
A layered architecture is like a layer cake. Each layer sits on top of the one below it and contributes to the whole. The bottom layer is the foundation, and it supports the weight of the upper layers. The next layer up is the crust, which gives structure to the cake and holds in all of the delicious filling. And finally, there are all of those yummy layers that make up the bulk of the cake.	layered architecture	What is a good analogy to explain layered architecture to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain layered architecture to a social science student would be like the layers of an onion. Each layer is separate from the other, but they are all connected.	layered architecture	What is a good analogy to explain layered architecture to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain limiting reactant and excess reactant to a social science student is as follows: imagine you are in a room with only ten pieces of candy. If every person took one piece of candy, there would be none left for anyone else. In this situation, the limiting reactant is the number of pieces of candy, and the amount of candy each person gets depends on how much they take before there is no more left. Now imagine that same room but with an unlimited number of pieces of candy. In this case, everyone could have as many pieces as they want and there would be no limit on how much anyone could eat. The excess reactant in this analogy is the number of pieces of candy; it's present in abundance and doesn't impose any limitations.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	What is a good analogy to explain limiting reactant and excess reactant to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain limiting reactant and excess reactant to a social science student would be that of two people trying to have a conversation in a noisy room.

The person who is not speaking (and trying to listen) is the excess reactant, because they are not adding anything to the conversation.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	What is a good analogy to explain limiting reactant and excess reactant to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain limiting reactant and excess reactant to a social science student is by comparing it to food. Imagine that you are cooking a Thanksgiving dinner for your family. You need two ingredients for the meal-turkey and potatoes. If you only have one potato, then you can only make one dish with that potato. However, if you have 10 potatoes, then you can make 10 dishes with those potatoes. The turkey is the limiting reactant because it is needed in smaller quantity than the potatoes. The excess reactant is the potatoes because they are not needed in limited quantity like the turkey.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	What is a good analogy to explain limiting reactant and excess reactant to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain a eukaryotic cell to a social science student would be like comparing the United States Congress to a small town. The U.S. Congress is made up of many smaller parts (representatives from each state), just as a eukaryotic cell has many smaller parts (proteins, organelles, etc.). Each part of the U.S. Congress works together to make decisions for the entire country, and each part of a eukaryotic cell works together to carry out its specific function within the cell.	eukaryotic cell	What is a good analogy to explain eukaryotic cell to a social science student?

A eukaryotic cell is like a small country. Just as a country has many different parts that work together to make it function (e.g., the military, government, economy, etc.), a eukaryotic cell has many different parts that work together to make it function (e.g., proteins, organelles, DNA, etc.). Each part has a specific job and purpose within the cell just as each part of a country has a specific job and purpose within the nation.	eukaryotic cell	What is a good analogy to explain eukaryotic cell to a social science student?

The best analogy to explain limiting reactant would be to compare it with a food. The food is the reactant and there are a certain number of calories or nutrients in that food. If you eat more than your body needs, you will get fat. If you eat too little, you will not have enough energy. It is the same with chemical reactions- if there is more of one reactant than the other, the reaction will stop until equilibrium is reached where both reactants are used up equally.	limiting reactant	What is a good analogy to explain limiting reactant to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain limiting reactant to a social science student would be to compare it to food. In order for the body to function properly, it needs a certain amount of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. If someone only consumes protein then their body will not get the other nutrients it needs and they will become malnourished. The same concept applies with limiting reactants in chemistry. If there is only one type of molecule present in a reaction then that molecule will be used up first and the reaction will stop.	limiting reactant	What is a good analogy to explain limiting reactant to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain limiting reactant to a social science student would be to say that it is like having only so many seats at a dinner table. If too many people try to sit down, someone will have to stand up. The same is true for chemical reactions - if there are too many molecules trying to participate in the reaction, then not all of them will be able to and the reaction will slow down.	limiting reactant	What is a good analogy to explain limiting reactant to a social science student?

One way to think about how trees calculate their age is by imagining a tree as a stack of coins. Every year that passes, another coin is added to the top of the stack. So, if you were to go visit a tree today that was planted exactly one year ago, you would find that there is only one coin at the base of the tree. If you went back to visit that same tree in 365 days from now, you would find an additional 366 coins (one for each day in a year) at the base of the tree - representing how much growth has occurred in just one year.	tree's age calculation	What is a good analogy to explain tree's age calculation to a social science student?
One way to think about a tree's age calculation is by imagining that the tree is a human. To find out how old someone is, you would add together all of the years they have been alive.

In contrast, if you threw a pebble into the same pond, it would create smaller and shorter-lived ripples than the rock.	anti-stokes scattering	What is a good analogy to explain anti-stokes scattering to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain anti-stokes scattering to a social science student is the reflection of light off a mirror. When light shines on a mirror, it is reflected back in the opposite direction. This occurs because the photons in the light collide with electrons in the mirror, and they bounce off each other. The same thing happens when light hits a particle that has been excited by an external energy source. The photon bounces off of the excited particle and loses some of its energy in the process. This is known as anti-stokes scattering	anti-stokes scattering	What is a good analogy to explain anti-stokes scattering to a social science student?

A median lethal dose could be explained as the amount of a toxin it takes to kill 50% of a population. For example, if you had 100 people and half of them were poisoned with a toxin that had a median lethal dose of 2 mg, then the other 50 people would need to be poisoned with more than 2 mg of the toxin in order to die.	median lethal dose	What is a good analogy to explain median lethal dose to a social science student?
A median lethal dose is the amount of a substance that will kill 50% of a population. A good analogy to explain this concept could be to think about a group of 100 people and imagine putting them all in one room. If you gave half of them a deadly poison, they would die. The other 50 people would not be affected because they didn't consume the poison. This is similar to what happens when we talk about the median lethal dose; it's the dose that kills 50% of the population.	median lethal dose	What is a good analogy to explain median lethal dose to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain median lethal dose to a social science student would be to compare it to the speed limit on a highway.

A social science student might understand the universe better if it is explained as a large city. The city has different neighborhoods, each with its own unique culture and flavor. There are also many different types of people who live in the city, each with their own individual story. The city is constantly changing, growing and evolving. Just like the universe, the city is full of mystery, wonder and endless possibilities.	universe	What is a good analogy to explain universe to a social science student?
The universe can be thought of as a large jigsaw puzzle. There are many pieces, some big and some small, and each piece has its own place in the overall picture. The universe is constantly changing, with new pieces being added all the time.	universe	What is a good analogy to explain universe to a social science student?
Enzyme mechanism is similar to the workings of a lock and key. The enzyme is the lock and the substrate (the molecule it acts on) is the key. When the correct key (substrate) is inserted into the lock (enzyme), it fits perfectly and the door (reaction site on the enzyme) opens, allowing for chemical catalysis to occur.	enzyme mechanism	What is a good analogy to explain enzyme mechanism to a social science student?
One analogy to explain enzyme mechanism would be the role of enzymes in digestion. Digestion is a process that breaks down food into smaller pieces so that it can be absorbed by the body. This process is carried out by digestive enzymes, which are proteins that catalyze the chemical reactions involved in digestion. Just as digestive enzymes break down food into smaller pieces, enzymes within cells also catalyze chemical reactions and help to build new molecules.	enzyme mechanism	What is a good analogy to explain enzyme mechanism to a social science student?
An enzyme is like a key that unlocks the door to chemical reactions. The key (enzyme) fits into a specific lock (substrate) on the door (chemical reaction). When the key is inserted, it causes the door to open and allows chemicals to flow in and react with each other.	enzyme mechanism	What is a good analogy to explain enzyme mechanism to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain anova to a social science student is that anova is the statistical equivalent of taking multiple pictures of the same object from different angles and then combining all the pictures into one image. This allows you to see the object in more detail than any one picture could provide on its own.	anova	What is a good analogy to explain anova to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain anova to a social science student is that it is like checking whether the paint on two different walls is the same color. You would mix some of each color together and then look at them next to each other. If they are mostly the same, then you can say that the colors are similar. If there is a lot of difference between the two colors, then you can say that they are not very similar.	anova	What is a good analogy to explain anova to a social science student?
A social science student might understand anova if it is explained as a comparison of three similar groups. Imagine that you are a teacher and want to know if there is a difference in the average test scores of boys, girls, and a mixed group of boys and girls. You would create three groups - one for each gender - and give them all the same test. The average score for each group would be compared to see if there was a difference between the genders.	anova	What is a good analogy to explain anova to a social science student?
A thermostat is a device that regulates the temperature in a room. It does this by turning on or off the heating or air conditioning unit based on the set temperature. This is similar to how social science students regulate their emotions. They set a goal (the desired temperature) and then work to maintain that emotional state.	thermostat	What is a good analogy to explain thermostat to a social science student?
A thermostat is a device that regulates the temperature of a room. It does this by turning on and off the furnace or air conditioning as needed.	thermostat	What is a good analogy to explain thermostat to a social science student?
A thermostat is a tool used to control the temperature of a room. It works by sensing the current temperature and turning on or off the heating or cooling system accordingly. In the same way, social science students use statistics to sense and understand patterns in data in order to make informed decisions.	thermostat	What is a good analogy to explain thermostat to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain chemical equilibrium to a social science student is the example of a crowded room. In this analogy, the molecules in the room are like people and the more people that are in the room, the more crowded it becomes. Eventually, there will be so many people in the room that it becomes too congested and uncomfortable. At this point, something needs to happen in order to relieve the crowding (either someone leaves or new people enter). This is similar to what happens with chemical equilibrium- when there is too much or too little of a particular molecule, equilibrium is reached as other molecules redistribute until balance is restored.	chemical equilibrium	What is a good analogy to explain chemical equilibrium to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain chemical equilibrium can be found by looking at the behavior of people in a crowd. People in a crowd will move around until they reach an equilibrium, meaning that they are all standing relatively close to each other and not moving. This is similar to what happens with chemicals in a solution; the molecules will move around until they reach equilibrium, meaning that the concentration of each molecule is the same throughout the solution.	chemical equilibrium	What is a good analogy to explain chemical equilibrium to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain chemical equilibrium to a social science student is that of two people standing on either side of a see-saw. If one person gets too heavy, the other person will move down the see-saw until they are both in balance. In the same way, if there is more reactant than product (or vice versa), the reaction will reach equilibrium as the products and reactants settle into an equal balance.	chemical equilibrium	What is a good analogy to explain chemical equilibrium to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain just-in-time would be to say that it is like a grocery store. A grocery store does not keep a lot of food on hand, but instead orders what it needs as customers come in. This way, the store does not have to waste money by buying too much food and then having to throw it away if it goes bad.	just-in-time	What is a good analogy to explain just-in-time to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain just-in-time to a social science student would be the way a grocery store operates. Grocery stores often do not have any food in their inventory until shortly before it is sold. This is because they get new shipments of food every day, and only order as much as they need for that day. This prevents them from having to waste money on food that will go bad by storing it too long, and it also means that customers can always find fresh produce at the store.	just-in-time	What is a good analogy to explain just-in-time to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain just-in-time to a social science student is that it is like traffic lights. Just-in-time means that the supplies and materials needed for production are delivered only as they are needed in the assembly line, so there is no excess inventory taking up space and money. This reduces waste and keeps costs down.	just-in-time	What is a good analogy to explain just-in-time to a social science student?
One analogy to explain adaptive immunity is that it is like a military defense system. The body's immune system is constantly on the lookout for invaders, such as viruses and bacteria. When an invader is detected, the body's immune system produces antibodies to fight off the infection.	adaptive immunity	What is a good analogy to explain adaptive immunity to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain adaptive immunity to a social science student is the human body's immune system being compared to a city's police force. The immune system is constantly working (i.e., patrolling the body) to identify and destroy any harmful invaders, while the police force responds quickly to any crime that occurs in the city.	adaptive immunity	What is a good analogy to explain adaptive immunity to a social science student?
One analogy to explain adaptive immunity could be as follows: Say you are in a large group of people and someone starts spreading a cold virus. Most people in the group will likely get sick, because they are exposed to the virus. However, if you have been vaccinated against the cold virus, you are much less likely to catch it, because your body has already created antibodies that will fight off the infection. In a similar way, when our bodies encounter a new pathogen (virus, bacteria, etc.), our adaptive immune system recognizes it as something foreign and creates specific antibodies to attack it. This allows us to mount an efficient immune response and hopefully prevent illness.	adaptive immunity	What is a good analogy to explain adaptive immunity to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain Ohm's law to a social science student would be to think of electrical current as being like water flowing through a pipe. Just as the size of the pipe (in terms of diameter) affects how much water can flow through it, so too does the size of an electrical conductor (in terms of diameter) affect how much electricity can flow through it. And just as increasing the pressure on the water in the pipe makes it flow faster, so too does increasing the voltage applied to an electrical conductor make electricity flow faster.	ohm's law	What is a good analogy to explain ohm's law to a social science student?
A resistor in an electrical circuit is like a tube of toothpaste. The more toothpaste in the tube, the harder it is to squeeze out. The more current flowing through a resistor, the harder it is to push that current through the resistor.	ohm's law	What is a good analogy to explain ohm's law to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain Ohm's law to a social science student would be the flow of water through a hose. Just as the amount of water that flows through a hose is determined by its width and how high the pressure is coming from behind it, so too is the amount of electricity that flows through a wire determined by its width (or "cross-sectional area") and how high the voltage is pushing against it.	ohm's law	What is a good analogy to explain ohm's law to a social science student?
Transcription is a bit like taking dictation. The transcriptionist listens to someone speaking and types out what they are saying.	transcription	What is a good analogy to explain transcription to a social science student?
Transcription is like taking dictation. The transcriptionist listens to someone speaking and types what they are saying verbatim into a document.	transcription	What is a good analogy to explain transcription to a social science student?
Transcription is like taking dictation. Someone speaks into a microphone and the words are recorded. The person who is transcribing then types out the spoken words into a document.	transcription	What is a good analogy to explain transcription to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain RNA polymerase would be to compare it to a construction worker. The construction worker is responsible for building the house, and the RNA polymerase is responsible for building the mRNA molecule.	rna polymerase	What is a good analogy to explain rna polymerase to a social science student?
A possible analogy to help explain RNA polymerase to a social science student is as follows: Imagine that you are at a party and want to make new friends. To do so, you will need something to introduce yourself with (your name), something to talk about (the party), and something else to keep the conversation going (shared interests). In the same way, RNA polymerase needs three things in order to create a new strand of DNA- it needs a nucleotide primer (your name), something to provide information about the sequence of bases it should copy (the party), and enzymes called helicases which keep the strands apart so that the polymerase can work efficiently.	rna polymerase	What is a good analogy to explain rna polymerase to a social science student?
Rna polymerase can be thought of as a secretary taking dictation. The rna polymerase reads the genetic code in the dna and copies it into an rna molecule.	rna polymerase	What is a good analogy to explain rna polymerase to a social science student?
A ribosome can be thought of as a translator in a foreign country. The ribosome takes the instructions from the DNA (the native language), and translates it into a protein that the cell can use (the foreign language).	ribosome	What is a good analogy to explain ribosome to a social science student?
A ribosome is like a translator. It takes the instructions in a gene (a recipe for making a protein) and converts them into proteins that the cell can use.	ribosome	What is a good analogy to explain ribosome to a social science student?
A ribosome is like a translator between two people who speak different languages. The ribosome helps to create proteins by reading the genetic code in DNA and then creating a corresponding sequence of amino acids.	ribosome	What is a good analogy to explain ribosome to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain activator protein to a social science student is that it is like the key to a lock. The activator protein unlocks the transcription factors so that they can bind to the DNA and start the process of gene expression.	activator protein	What is a good analogy to explain activator protein to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain activator protein to a social science student is the role of a bouncer in a nightclub. The bouncer is responsible for verifying that each person who wants to enter the club has a valid ticket, and then he or she lets them into the club. In the same way, activator proteins are responsible for verifying that each gene has been turned on (or "activated") and then they let it do its job.	activator protein	What is a good analogy to explain activator protein to a social science student?
One analogy to help explain activator protein is the role of a director in a movie. The activator protein is responsible for initiating and guiding the transcription process, similar to how a director oversees all aspects of making a movie.	activator protein	What is a good analogy to explain activator protein to a social science student?
A social science student might understand electric circuits if they were compared to water pipes. Just as the amount of water (flow) through a pipe is controlled by the size of the opening on either end (orifice), the amount of electricity flowing through an electrical circuit is controlled by the size of the opening on either end (electrode).	electric circuit	What is a good analogy to explain electric circuit to a social science student?
An electric circuit is like a group of people who are all connected to each other. If one person in the group talks, the whole group hears what they say. If one person in the group turns on a light, the whole group sees the light.	electric circuit	What is a good analogy to explain electric circuit to a social science student?
Electric circuits can be thought of as similar to the flow of water in a pipe. Just as the water flows through the pipe until it reaches a closed end, electricity flows through a circuit until it reaches an open end (a break in the circuit).	electric circuit	What is a good analogy to explain electric circuit to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain the hydrophobic effect to a social science student is that of two magnets. If you have two magnets and you try to push them together, they will resist because the positive sides of each magnet want to repel each other. This is similar to how water molecules are attracted to one another (via hydrogen bonds) but repelled by other water molecules due to their negative ends.	hydrophobic effect	What is a good analogy to explain hydrophobic effect to a social science student?
One analogy to explain the hydrophobic effect to a social science student is that it is similar to two magnets repelling each other. Water molecules are attracted to each other, but they are repelled by the hydrophobic (water-hating) molecule.	hydrophobic effect	What is a good analogy to explain hydrophobic effect to a social science student?
Water molecules are attracted to each other by hydrogen bonds. This attraction creates clusters of water molecules. The surface of a hydrophobic molecule is not attractive to water molecules because it does not have any hydrogen bonds. So the hydrophobic molecule will be surrounded by water molecules, while the hydrophilic molecule will be dispersed in the water.	hydrophobic effect	What is a good analogy to explain hydrophobic effect to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain biological signal transduction to a social science student is the process of communication between two people. Just as different signals (words, facial expressions, body language) are sent and received between two people, various molecules and proteins send and receive signals within a cell. These signals initiate or regulate many important cellular processes.	biological signal transduction	What is a good analogy to explain biological signal transduction to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain biological signal transduction to a social science student would be the process of sending and receiving emails. The email sender creates a message, puts it in an envelope, and attaches a stamp. The message is then sent through the postal service to its destination. When the recipient receives the message, they open it and read the contents.	biological signal transduction	What is a good analogy to explain biological signal transduction to a social science student?
A good analogy to explain biological signal transduction to a social science student is the telephone system. The phone system has many parts including wires, telephone poles, and a switchboard. When you pick up the receiver of a phone, you create an electrical current that travels through the wires to the pole and then switches on a light at the other end. The light signals the person who is supposed to be receiving your call that someone is trying to reach them. In much the same way, when a hormone or neurotransmitter binds to its receptor on a cell membrane, it creates an electrical current that travels through the cell and turns on certain genes. This process allows cells to respond quickly to changes in their environment	biological signal transduction	What is a good analogy to explain biological signal transduction to a social science student?
