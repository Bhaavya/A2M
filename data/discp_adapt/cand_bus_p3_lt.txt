An activator protein is like a key that unlocks a door. The activator protein binds to a specific site on the DNA molecule and then activates the transcription of that gene.	activator protein	Explain activator protein using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for a business student.
Electricity is like water in a pipe. The voltage is the water pressure, and the current is the amount of water flowing through the pipe. The resistance is like a pipe with a lot of holes in it, which slows down the water flow. The capacitance is like a big tank of water that can store a lot of energy. The inductance is like a coil of wire that can store energy in the magnetic field.	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for a business student.
The hydrophobic effect is similar to a group of people who are all huddled together in a small, dark room. The people are uncomfortable and want to get out of the room, but they are all stuck together. The hydrophobic effect is like this because the water molecules are stuck together and they don't want to be around the other water molecules.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for a business student.
Biological signal transduction can be thought of as a process similar to the way a company uses marketing to send a message to its customers. The company's marketing department creates a message, which is then sent to the company's customers. The customers then receive the message and react to it. In the same way, cells use signal transduction to send messages to each other. The cells create a message, which is then sent to other cells. The other cells then receive the message and react to it.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for a business student.
