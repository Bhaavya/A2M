When we need energy, such as during exercise, our body breaks down the glycogen and uses it to power our cells. Just like a car needs gas to run, our bodies need glycogen to function properly	glycogen	Using an analogy, explain glycogen to a business student.
Glycogen is like a business student's bank account. It is a storage area for glucose, which the body can use for energy.

The cytoskeleton is like the scaffolding in a construction site. It provides support for the cells and helps them to keep their shape.	cytoskeleton	Using an analogy, explain cytoskeleton to a business student.
ATP is essentially the "fuel" that powers muscles. Muscles need ATP in order to contract, and this ATP comes from the breakdown of food molecules (carbohydrates and fats) within the muscle cells. When a person exercises, their muscles need more energy than usual, so they break down more food molecules to create more ATP. This is what causes people to get tired after exercising - their muscles are using up all of their energy!	atp	Using an analogy, explain atp to a business student.
Atp is like the gasoline that powers a car. It is used to create energy in the body, which allows us to move and function.	atp	Using an analogy, explain atp to a business student.
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the "currency" of energy for cells. It is used to power everything from muscle movements to chemical reactions. When a cell needs more energy, it breaks down ATP into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). ADP can then be re-used to create more ATP.	atp	Using an analogy, explain atp to a business student.
NADPH is similar to money in a bank account. It represents a store of energy that can be used to do work (in this case, produce glucose from carbon dioxide and water).	nadph	Using an analogy, explain nadph to a business student.
NADPH would be to a business student as the blood running through veins and arteries is to the human body. NADPH helps by delivering oxygen and glucose (sugar) to all of the cells in the body - including those in muscles, where energy is needed for movement. It also helps remove wastes from cells.	nadph	Using an analogy, explain nadph to a business student.
Just as oxygen is the lifeblood of humans, nadph is the lifeblood of plants. It helps produce energy in the chloroplasts of plant cells, allowing them to create glucose from light and carbon dioxide.

This helps to keep the company running smoothly and efficiently, without having to waste valuable resources on unused materials.	peroxysome	Using an analogy, explain peroxysome to a business student.
Peroxysomes are like the "recycling bins" of a business. They take in damaged or old proteins, break them down into their component parts, and then release those parts so that they can be reused to build new proteins. This recycling process is important for keeping cells healthy and functioning properly.	peroxysome	Using an analogy, explain peroxysome to a business student.
Mytochondria is similar to a business in the sense that it is responsible for producing energy for the cell. Just as a business needs money to operate, mytochondria need oxygen and glucose to produce energy.	mytochondria	Using an analogy, explain mytochondria to a business student.
Mytochondria are the cells within a business that produce energy. The mitochondria produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used by the cells to carry out their functions. Without ATP, the cells would not be able to function and the business would collapse.	mytochondria	Using an analogy, explain mytochondria to a business student.
Mytochondria are the cells in our body that produce energy. In business, this would be equivalent to the workers who produce the products or services. Just as mytochondria need energy to function, workers need a salary and benefits in order to do their job.	mytochondria	Using an analogy, explain mytochondria to a business student.
Electric forces are similar to gravitational forces in that they both involve a pulling or pushing action between two objects. However, electric force is caused by the electric fields that extend from electrically charged particles, while gravitational force is caused by the mass of an object. Gravitational force is much stronger than electric force, but only works over very large distances. Electric force can act over small distances and is very powerful.	electric forces	Using an analogy, explain electric forces to a business student.
Electric forces are like people in a room. The closer two people are to each other, the more force they feel between them. If you have ever been to a party, you know that when people stand close together they can feel each other's energy and it creates a kind of excitement. Electric forces work in much the same way.	electric forces	Using an analogy, explain electric forces to a business student.
Electric forces are similar to the gravitational force between two masses, but they occur when there is an electric charge instead of a mass. Like gravity, electric forces decrease as the distance between the charges increases.	electric forces	Using an analogy, explain electric forces to a business student.
In business school, one of the first things students learn is about the different types of company structures. There are three main types of company structures: sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations. A hydrogen electron's orbital can be thought of as a type of company structure. The electron's orbital is shaped like a sphere with the nucleus at its center. The electron can move around the nucleus in any direction within the sphere. This corresponds to a sole proprietorship where there is one owner who has complete control over the business. The electron's orbital can also be thought of as a partnership where two or more people own and operate the business together. In this case, the electrons would share space within the orbtial equally. Finally, an electron's orbital can be thought of as a corporation where there are multiple owners but each owner has limited liability for the debts and actions taken by the company.	hydrogen electron's orbital	Using an analogy, explain hydrogen electron's orbital to a business student.
The hydrogen electron's orbital can be thought of as a kind of "orbit" around the nucleus. The higher the number on the orbit, the further away from the nucleus it is.	hydrogen electron's orbital	Using an analogy, explain hydrogen electron's orbital to a business student.
A hydrogen electron's orbital can be thought of as a company's office. The electron is free to move about the office in any direction, but it spends most of its time in certain areas (or orbits) around the room. In the same way, an electron in a hydrogen atom spends most of its time near the nucleus, but it is free to move about in any direction.	hydrogen electron's orbital	Using an analogy, explain hydrogen electron's orbital to a business student.
The first line of defense in the body is analogous to a company's front-line employees. These are the people who interact with customers and are responsible for customer service. They are also responsible for protecting the company from potential threats, such as fraudulent activity or theft. Just as the first line of defense in the body protects against outside threats, front-line employees protect a business from external threats.	first line of defense in the body	Using an analogy, explain first line of defense in the body to a business student.
The body's first line of defense is analogous to a business' security system. The body's first line of defense is made up of the skin, mucous membranes, tears, and saliva.

In a business, the security system protects the premises from burglary and theft.	first line of defense in the body	Using an analogy, explain first line of defense in the body to a business student.
In the business world, the first line of defense is typically the front-line employees. They are the ones who interact with customers and have the most contact with potential sources of danger or harm. In a similar way, our body's first line of defense is composed of the organs that are closest to the outside world: our skin, nose, and mouth. These organs act as a barrier against harmful substances and agents.	first line of defense in the body	Using an analogy, explain first line of defense in the body to a business student.

They remove clutter and waste products, ensuring that the work environment is safe and functional.	macrophages	Using an analogy, explain macrophages to a business student.
A t-helper cell is like a human resources manager in a business. The human resources manager oversees the hiring process, ensuring that all new employees are qualified and meet the company's standards. Similarly, the t-helper cell oversees the activation of other immune cells, making sure they are properly equipped to fight off infection.	t-helper cells	Using an analogy, explain t-helper cells to a business student.
Just as a company needs employees to carry out various tasks, the body needs t-helper cells to help fight infection and disease.

Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes can be thought of as the "terminators" of the immune system. They are responsible for finding and destroying cells that have been infected by viruses or other pathogens, such as cancer cells. In business terms, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes can be thought of as the company's "elite strike force" - they are called in when a serious threat needs to be addressed quickly and decisively.	cytotoxic t-lymphocytes	Using an analogy, explain cytotoxic t-lymphocytes to a business student.
When a business expands into new markets, it is invading the territory of other businesses. The business may be successful in its invasion if it has a good product and an effective marketing strategy. Likewise, when bacteria invade a host cell, they are competing for resources with the host cells. If the bacteria are able to reproduce faster than the host cells, they will take over the cell and thrive.	invasion of bacterias	Using an analogy, explain invasion of bacterias to a business student.
Just as bacteria can invade and take over an organism, companies can invade and take over a market. When a company enters into a new market, it is essentially invading that market. The company will attempt to establish itself by introducing its products or services and competing with the other companies in the area. If it is successful, the company may eventually dominate the market.	invasion of bacterias	Using an analogy, explain invasion of bacterias to a business student.
One way to think of the invasion of bacteria is in terms of a business analogy. Imagine that your business is thriving, with customers coming in and spending money regularly. Suddenly, a rival company opens up shop right next door, offering the same products and services as you do but at a lower price. They start luring away your customers, who begin to disappear from your store altogether. This is what's happening when bacteria invade your body - they're competing for resources (such as nutrients and space) and taking away what's needed to keep you healthy.	invasion of bacterias	Using an analogy, explain invasion of bacterias to a business student.
A business student might understand action potential if you explained it as an electrical signal that travels down a nerve fiber. This signal is created by the movement of positively charged ions into and out of the cell membrane. The action potential then causes the release of neurotransmitters, which relay messages to other cells.	action potential	Using an analogy, explain action potential to a business student.
When the boss wants something done, he sends an email to his employees. This is analogous to the way a nerve cell transmits a signal. An action potential is like an email with a message that says "do this." The message is encoded in electrical and chemical signals that pass down the neuron's axon. When it reaches the end of the axon, it causes tiny packets of neurotransmitters to be released into the synapse. These neurotransmitters cross over to the next neuron and stimulate it to send an electric current down its own axon. This process continues until the message reaches its destination, or until enough neurons have been activated to produce a muscle contraction or some other response.	action potential	Using an analogy, explain action potential to a business student.
An action potential is like a tiny electrical spark that travels down an axon, the long nerve fiber. This spark triggers the release of neurotransmitters, which then transmit signals to other cells in the body.	action potential	Using an analogy, explain action potential to a business student.
Chromatography is like a funnel. The different colors of ink (representing different compounds) are poured into the top of the funnel, and as they flow through the chromatography paper, they separate based on their chemical properties. At the end of the chromatography paper, each color will be at a different spot, allowing you to see which compounds were in each color of ink.	experiment of chromatography	Using an analogy, explain experiment of chromatography to a business student.
Extracting ink from a pen using chromatography is similar to extracting essential oils from plants using distillation. In both cases, the goal is to isolate a desired component from a complex mixture. The difference is that in chromatography, the desired component is dissolved in a liquid solvent, while in distillation it is vaporized.	experiment of chromatography	Using an analogy, explain experiment of chromatography to a business student.
Chromatography is a laboratory technique used to separate the components of a mixture. The mixture is dissolved in a solvent, which is then passed through a column containing an adsorbent material. The different components of the mixture are adsorbed by the material at different rates, allowing them to be separated.	experiment of chromatography	Using an analogy, explain experiment of chromatography to a business student.
A star’s lifespan can be described as its main sequence lifetime. This is the amount of time a star spends burning hydrogen in its core to create energy. The longer a star spends on the main sequence, the more stable it is and the longer it will live. A business student might understand this concept by analogy with a company’s lifecycle. A young startup is full of energy and promise, but may not have stability or longevity. A well-established company, on the other hand, has both stability and longevity thanks to its strong foundation and long history	main-sequence lifetimes of stars	Using an analogy, explain main-sequence lifetimes of stars to a business student.
Stars on the main sequence have stable lifetimes because they are in a state of equilibrium. The business student can think of the main sequence as being similar to a company that is in a stable, profitable state. This company will continue to operate and make money as long as it remains in balance. However, if something happens to upset this balance (e.g., economic recession), the company may begin to lose money and eventually go out of business. In the same way, stars on the main sequence can "go out of business" if something happens to disrupt their equilibrium state.	main-sequence lifetimes of stars	Using an analogy, explain main-sequence lifetimes of stars to a business student.
A star's lifetime is determined by its mass. The higher the mass, the shorter the lifespan. A star in the main sequence has enough fuel to continue burning for billions of years. Once it exhausts its fuel, it dies and becomes a white dwarf, black hole, or neutron star.	main-sequence lifetimes of stars	Using an analogy, explain main-sequence lifetimes of stars to a business student.

In a business, sometimes there is too much inventory or too many employees. These "extra" things take up space and can be cumbersome. Vacuoles are like these extra things in a business- they take up space and can be cumbersome. Just as businesses need to find ways to get rid of excess inventory or employees, cells must find ways to get rid of their vacuoles.	vacuoles	Using an analogy, explain vacuoles to a business student.
Cytoplasm can be thought of as the raw materials and resources used by a business to produce goods or services. The cytoplasm contains all of the necessary components for DNA replication, gene expression, protein synthesis, and many other cellular processes.

Cytoplasm is like the employees of a business. The nucleus is the boss and the cytoplasm are the workers who do all of the work to keep things running.	cytoplasm	Using an analogy, explain cytoplasm to a business student.
The cytoplasm can be thought of as the "lifeblood" of a cell - it is the substance within cells that contains organelles and allows chemical reactions to take place. In the business world, cytoplasm can be seen as the essential element or foundation upon which a company is built. It represents all of the resources, processes, and people involved in running the company. Just as cells cannot function without cytoplasm, businesses cannot operate effectively without a strong cytoplasmic foundation.	cytoplasm	Using an analogy, explain cytoplasm to a business student.
Chromosomes are like the blueprints for a business. They contain all of the information needed to build and run the business.	chromosome	Using an analogy, explain chromosome to a business student.

The cytosol is the liquid inside of a cell. It contains all of the cellular machinery needed to keep the cell alive and functioning. The cytosol also contains proteins and other molecules that allow cells to communicate with each other and interact with their environment.	cytosol	Using an analogy, explain cytosol to a business student.
Cytosol is like the blood in our veins. It carries nutrients and oxygen to all of the cells in our body, allowing them to function properly. In a business analogy, cytosol would be like the sales department. It is responsible for getting products (nutrients and oxygen) to all of the other departments (the cells), so that they can do their jobs effectively.	cytosol	Using an analogy, explain cytosol to a business student.
The cell is the basic unit of life. It is the smallest living thing and can only be seen with a microscope. Cells come together to form tissues, which in turn make up organs. Tissues and organs work together to carry out the functions of the body.	cell	Using an analogy, explain cell to a business student.
A cell is like a small business. It has its own workers, resources, and products. Cells also work together to create larger organisms. Just as businesses compete with each other for customers and resources, cells compete with each other for space and nutrients inside the organism.	cell	Using an analogy, explain cell to a business student.
A cell is a basic unit of life. It is the smallest living thing that can exist on its own. Cells are found in all living things, from plants to animals.	cell	Using an analogy, explain cell to a business student.
A vesicle is like a small container that can hold things. It is like a tiny bag that can be filled with something and then released. Vesicles are often used to release drugs or other medicines into the body.	vesicles	Using an analogy, explain vesicles to a business student.
Vesicles can be thought of as small, enclosed spaces within a cell that are used to store and transport molecules. Similar to how a business might use different departments (marketing, accounting, human resources) to manage different aspects of their company, vesicles help cells compartmentalize their functions. For example, vesicles in the cytoplasm might contain proteins that are needed for cell division, while others might carry lipids or carbohydrates.	vesicles	Using an analogy, explain vesicles to a business student.
A vesicle is a small, round container that can hold chemicals or other substances. It is similar to a capsule but is smaller in size. Vesicles are used by the body to deliver nutrients and other important substances to cells. They can also be used to remove waste products from cells.	vesicles	Using an analogy, explain vesicles to a business student.
Cell wall can be analogized to a business’s financial statement. Just as the cell wall is the boundary of the cell, a company’s financial statement is the boundary of what information is available to its shareholders and creditors. The cell wall consists of proteins and carbohydrates that give the cell strength and rigidity, similar to how a company’s assets protect it from liabilities. Finally, just as cells communicate with one another through chemical signals, businesses interact with each other through economic signals.	cell wall	Using an analogy, explain cell wall to a business student.
A cell wall is like a security system for a business. It helps to keep out intruders and protect the businesses' property. The cell wall is also necessary for the business to function properly, just as a security system is necessary for a safe workplace.	cell wall	Using an analogy, explain cell wall to a business student.
Cell wall can be thought of as a company's firewall. It is a barrier that helps protect the company from unauthorized access and cyber attacks. Like a firewall, cell wall also helps keep the company's data and systems secure.	cell wall	Using an analogy, explain cell wall to a business student.
Cells are like the individual employees in a business. Just as each employee has a specific job to do, each cell has a specific function within the body. Cells work together to keep the business running smoothly.	cells	Using an analogy, explain cells to a business student.
Cells are the basic building blocks of life. Just as businesses are made up of smaller parts (employees, departments, etc.), cells are made up of smaller parts (proteins, DNA, etc.). Cells work together to create something larger and more complex - just as businesses work together to create something larger and more complex.	cells	Using an analogy, explain cells to a business student.
The body of a business is like the cells in the human body. The cells are the basic unit that make up the body. In the same way, businesses are made up of smaller units called departments. Just as each cell has specific functions within the human body, each department in a business has a specific function.	cells	Using an analogy, explain cells to a business student.
The cell membrane can be thought of as a protective barrier that separates the inner contents of a cell from the outside environment. It is made up of a lipid bilayer, which is composed of two layers of lipids (fats) that are held together by weak chemical bonds. The lipids in the membrane are arranged so that their hydrophobic (water-repelling) tails face inward and their hydrophilic (water-attracting) heads face outward. This arrangement helps to keep water and other molecules out of the cell while allowing essential nutrients and oxygen to enter.	cell membrane	Using an analogy, explain cell membrane to a business student.
Just as a business needs walls to keep its employees and products inside, a cell also has boundaries. The cell membrane is the equivalent of those walls for a cell. It is made up of proteins and lipids (fats) that form a barrier around the cells. This barrier helps to control what goes in and out of the cells, allowing only certain things to pass through.	cell membrane	Using an analogy, explain cell membrane to a business student.
The cell membrane can be thought of as the "border" or "gatekeeper" of the cell. It is a thin layer of lipid (fat) and protein molecules that surrounds the cell and acts as a barrier, allowing some things into the cell while keeping other things out. The proteins in the membrane are responsible for recognizing and binding to specific molecules (such as nutrients or toxins), which allows or denies them access to the cell.	cell membrane	Using an analogy, explain cell membrane to a business student.
The golgi body can be thought of as the business student's "office." It is a site within the cell where proteins are modified and sorted before being sent to their final destination. Just as a good office manager ensures that everything is organized and running smoothly, the golgi body helps to ensure that proteins are properly modified and delivered to where they need to go.	golgi body	Using an analogy, explain golgi body to a business student.
Golgi body is the equivalent of a company's shipping and receiving department. It is responsible for packaging and sending products (proteins) created by the ribosomes to their correct destinations (cellular membranes).	golgi body	Using an analogy, explain golgi body to a business student.
The Golgi body can be thought of as the "mailroom" of a business. It is responsible for receiving and sorting packages (or proteins) from different parts of the company, and then sending them on to their appropriate destinations.	golgi body	Using an analogy, explain golgi body to a business student.
When two objects are placed near each other, an electric field forms between them. The strength of this electric field is determined by the capacitance of the objects. Capacitance is a measure of how much energy can be stored in the electric field.	capacitance	Using an analogy, explain capacitance to a business student.
A capacitor is like a container of water. The more water that is in the container, the more weight it has. Just like with capacitance, the more electrons that are stored in the capacitor, the more weight it has.	capacitance	Using an analogy, explain capacitance to a business student.
A capacitor is a device that can store an electric charge. It does this by having two metal plates separated by an insulating material. When you apply a voltage to the capacitor, it will start to fill up with electricity. The more voltage you apply, the more charge it will hold.	capacitance	Using an analogy, explain capacitance to a business student.
Electric current is like the flow of water in a river. Just as the water flows downstream and has a certain amount of power, electric current flows through wires and devices to provide power.	electric current	Using an analogy, explain electric current to a business student.
Electric current is the flow of electrons through a conductor, similar to the way water flows through a pipe. Just as businesses need a steady supply of water to function, they also need a steady supply of electricity to function.	electric current	Using an analogy, explain electric current to a business student.
Electric current is like the flow of water in a river. Just as the amount of water flowing through a river depends on the size of the river and how much water is flowing into it, so too does the amount of electric current depend on the size of the wire and how much voltage is applied to it.	electric current	Using an analogy, explain electric current to a business student.
Voltage can be thought of as the pressure or force that makes electricity flow. Just like water needs a certain amount of pressure to flow through a pipe, electricity needs voltage (or electrical pressure) to move along wires and devices. Think of voltage as the power behind your electronics—the higher the voltage, the more powerful the current.	voltage	Using an analogy, explain voltage to a business student.
Voltage is like the amount of pressure that is needed to make water flow through a pipe. Voltage is what makes electricity move through power lines, and it's what your electronic gadgets use to work. Just as you need a certain water pressure (voltage) in order for the water to flow at all, you need a certain voltage in order for electricity to flow at all.	voltage	Using an analogy, explain voltage to a business student.
In business, voltage can be thought of as power or energy. Just as in an electrical circuit, a higher voltage means more power or energy is available to do work. For example, a 100-volt lightbulb will be brighter than a 10-volt lightbulb. Similarly, businesses need more voltage (or power) to run larger operations with more employees and equipment.	voltage	Using an analogy, explain voltage to a business student.
Just as a business needs to specialize in order to produce a good or service, cells need to specialize in order to carry out the many functions of life. In addition, businesses need to communicate with each other in order to coordinate their activities; likewise, cells use communication signals to relay information between different parts of the cell. By working together, businesses can produce things that they could never create on their own, and cells can carry out complex tasks by using the specialized abilities of different parts of the cell.	specialization and communication in a cell	Using an analogy, explain specialization and communication in a cell to a business student.
In a business, specialization is when different employees are responsible for different tasks. For example, one person might be in charge of accounting, another might be in charge of marketing, and so on. Communication happens when employees share information with each other in order to make sure that everyone is on the same page. This can happen verbally or through written memos or emails.	specialization and communication in a cell	Using an analogy, explain specialization and communication in a cell to a business student.
In a business, specialization is when workers are assigned specific tasks to complete in order to produce the company's product. Communication is necessary for workers to be able to relay information and instructions to one another so that they can all work together efficiently. In a cell, specialization refers to different parts of the cell performing specific functions (such as producing energy or proteins) in order for the cell to survive. Communication between cells allows them to share resources and coordinate their activities.	specialization and communication in a cell	Using an analogy, explain specialization and communication in a cell to a business student.
Kirchhoff's voltage law is a business student analogy for the conservation of energy principle in physics. Just as businesses need to conserve resources (money, manpower, etc.) to be successful, so too must electrical circuits conserve energy. The law states that the sum of voltages around a closed loop in an electrical circuit is zero. This means that the amount of energy entering one part of a circuit must equal the amount leaving that part of the circuit.	kirchoff's voltage law	Using an analogy, explain kirchoff's voltage law to a business student.
Kirchoff's Voltage Law states that the sum of all voltages in a closed circuit is zero. To put it more simply, the law states that electricity always flows in one direction through a circuit and that there is no build-up of voltage or current. This law is important for business students because it helps to understand how electrical circuits work and how they can be used to power machines or appliances.	kirchoff's voltage law	Using an analogy, explain kirchoff's voltage law to a business student.
Just as in a business, the flow of electricity (voltage) is important in a circuit. In order to keep the voltage consistent and organized, Kirchoff's Voltage Law states that the sum of all voltages in a closed loop must be zero. This law helps ensure that there isn't too much or too little voltage running through different parts of a circuit, which could damage components or create an unsafe situation.	kirchoff's voltage law	Using an analogy, explain kirchoff's voltage law to a business student.
A density wave is a type of ripple that travels through a medium. The wave can be caused by something moving through the medium, such as a boat passing through water, or it can be generated by an outside force, such as wind blowing across the surface of the water. The waves created by movement are known as primary waves, while those created by outside forces are called secondary waves.	nature of a density wave	Using an analogy, explain nature of a density wave to a business student.
A density wave is like a crowd of people walking through a doorway. The people in the front are moving quickly, and the people in the back are moving more slowly. As new people enter the front of the crowd, they push old people towards the back.	nature of a density wave	Using an analogy, explain nature of a density wave to a business student.
A density wave is like a group of people walking through a park. As more and more people join the wave, the space between each person becomes smaller.	nature of a density wave	Using an analogy, explain nature of a density wave to a business student.
Enzymes are like the workforce of a business. They are responsible for completing all the tasks that allow the business to run smoothly. Enzymes help break down food, process waste, and create energy so that the business can function properly. Without enzymes, the business would not be able to operate.	enzymes	Using an analogy, explain enzymes to a business student.
Enzymes can be thought of as the "workers" of the body. They are responsible for chemical reactions throughout the body, including converting food into energy. Just like a business needs workers to do different tasks in order to function, the body needs enzymes to help with all sorts of chemical reactions.	enzymes	Using an analogy, explain enzymes to a business student.
Enzymes are like small machines that help to speed up chemical reactions in the body. In business, enzymes would be like a tool that helps to make things run more smoothly and quickly.	enzymes	Using an analogy, explain enzymes to a business student.
Human active memory system can be compared to a computer’s RAM. Just as computer RAM holds data that is currently being used by the processor, human active memory stores information that is currently being accessed or thought about. The contents of human active memory are constantly changing as new information is added and old information is forgotten or discarded. Like a computer, humans can only retain a limited amount of information in active memory at any given time.	human active memory system	Using an analogy, explain human active memory system to a business student.
The human active memory system can be compared to a computer's random-access memory (RAM). The RAM is where the computer temporarily stores data that is currently being used. The more RAM you have, the more data your computer can store at one time. Similarly, the more active memory you have, the more information you can store in your mind at one time. Just like a computer, if you try to store too much information in your active memory, it will become cluttered and difficult to access. To keep your active memory clear and organized, it is important to regularly review and discard old information.	human active memory system	Using an analogy, explain human active memory system to a business student.
Active Memory is like a computer’s RAM. It is where we store the things that we are currently working on. The more active memory you have, the more you can do at once. Just like with a computer, if you don’t have enough RAM, your performance will suffer.	human active memory system	Using an analogy, explain human active memory system to a business student.
The rate-determining step is the slowest step in a reaction. This is important for businesses because it means that if they want to speed up a reaction, they need to focus on speeding up the rate-determining step.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Using an analogy, explain rate-determining step of a reaction to a business student.
The rate-determining step of a reaction is the slowest step in a reaction. The rate-determining step determines how fast a reaction will take place. In business, understanding the rate-determining step can help you determine how quickly you can expect a project to be completed.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Using an analogy, explain rate-determining step of a reaction to a business student.
The rate-determining step of a reaction is the slowest step in a reaction. It is the step that determines how fast a reaction will occur. For example, if you are baking cookies, the rate-determining step is when the dough goes into the oven. The cookies will not be done until the oven cooks them for long enough.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Using an analogy, explain rate-determining step of a reaction to a business student.
Column chromatography is a technique used to separate mixtures of compounds. A column is packed with a solid material, such as silica gel or alumina, and the mixture is poured over the top. The compounds in the mixture will move through the column at different rates, depending on their size, shape, and polarity. The most polar molecules will move fastest while the least polar molecules will move slowest. At the end of the column, each compound will be separated into its own individual container.	column chromatography	Using an analogy, explain column chromatography to a business student.
Column chromatography is a technique used to purify substances by separating them into their component parts. The purified substances can then be isolated and used in various applications, such as in the production of pharmaceuticals or other commercial products.	column chromatography	Using an analogy, explain column chromatography to a business student.
Column chromatography is the process of separating a mixture into its individual parts through the use of a column filled with silica gel or alumina. The different components in the mixture travel down the column at different speeds, allowing them to be separated.	column chromatography	Using an analogy, explain column chromatography to a business student.
Dynamic chemical equilibrium can be thought of as a business that is always in balance. No matter what actions are taken by the business, it will eventually return to a state of equilibrium where income and expenses are equal. In the same way, chemical reactions always reach a point where the concentrations of reactants and products are constant.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Using an analogy, explain dynamic chemical equilibrium to a business student.
Dynamic chemical equilibrium can be explained as a business analogy with two companies, A and B. Company A starts out with more customers (reactants) than company B. Over time, company B catches up to company A in terms of number of customers. However, even though the number of customers is equal, company A continues to generate more sales revenue than company B because it has more customers. This analogy represents dynamic chemical equilibrium because at any given moment the number of reactants and products are equal, but over time the reactant population will change as new products are formed.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Using an analogy, explain dynamic chemical equilibrium to a business student.
Dynamic chemical equilibrium is like a business that is always making money, but it also spends money. The business makes a profit by taking in more money than it spends. In the same way, dynamic chemical equilibrium takes in reactants (molecules that can start a reaction) and produces products (molecules formed as a result of the reaction), but it also uses up some of the reactants to produce the products.	dynamic chemical equilibrium	Using an analogy, explain dynamic chemical equilibrium to a business student.
A vacuole is like a storage locker in a business. It is used to store things that are not needed right now, but may be needed in the future.	vacuole	Using an analogy, explain vacuole to a business student.

In business, a transport vesicle would be like a UPS truck. It transports goods from one place to another. The goods are placed inside the truck and transported to their destination.	transport vesicles	Using an analogy, explain transport vesicles to a business student.
A business student might understand transport vesicles if they think of them as small trucks that carry goods from one part of a city to another. The trucks (transport vesicles) are filled with the goods (molecules or proteins) and drive around until they reach their destination.	transport vesicles	Using an analogy, explain transport vesicles to a business student.
A business student may understand transport vesicles if they are explained using an analogy. Transport vesicles can be thought of as small, enclosed cars that carry goods from one part of a city to another. The goods are loaded into the car at one location and then driven to the desired destination. Once there, the car is unloaded and its contents are delivered. This analogy can help explain how transport vesicles work in cells: materials (the goods) are transported from one place in the cell to another by way of these small, enclosed vehicles.	transport vesicles	Using an analogy, explain transport vesicles to a business student.
A proto-oncogene is like a new product in the early stages of development at a company. It may have potential, but it has not been fully tested yet. Oncogenes are like products that have been on the market for a while and have proven to be successful.	proto-oncogenes	Using an analogy, explain proto-oncogenes to a business student.
Proto-oncogenes can be thought of as "early warning signals" in the cell. They are like a businessperson's early indicators that something may be wrong, such as an increase in spending or a decrease in profits. If proto-oncogenes are ignored, they may lead to cancerous tumors. In the same way, if a business ignores its early warning signs, it may end up filing for bankruptcy.	proto-oncogenes	Using an analogy, explain proto-oncogenes to a business student.
Proto-oncogenes are like the seed of a plant. The proto-oncogene is the beginning of a cancerous tumor. It is not cancerous by itself, but it has the potential to become cancerous if it mutates and starts to grow out of control.	proto-oncogenes	Using an analogy, explain proto-oncogenes to a business student.
An oncogene is a gene that, when mutated, can cause cancer. It is like a business executive who, when corrupted, can lead the company into bankruptcy. The oncogene is the root of the problem and needs to be controlled in order to prevent cancer from developing.	oncogenes	Using an analogy, explain oncogenes to a business student.
Like oncogenes, businesses can be either healthy or unhealthy. A healthy business is one that is profitable and growing. An unhealthy business is one that is losing money and/or shrinking in size. Oncogenes are genes that can cause cancer when they are mutated. Similarly, an unhealthy business can be said to have a "cancer" of sorts, which refers to the problems (e.g., financial losses, layoffs) that arise as a result of the company's poor health.	oncogenes	Using an analogy, explain oncogenes to a business student.
Oncogenes are genes that can cause cancer. They are like a business that is doing very well and is making a lot of money. This business is growing rapidly and is becoming more successful every day. However, this business also has the potential to become dangerous if it is not managed properly.	oncogenes	Using an analogy, explain oncogenes to a business student.
Tumor suppressor genes can be thought of as the "quality control" department in a business. They are responsible for making sure that cells grow and divide normally, without any mistakes. If something goes wrong (for example, if a cell starts dividing too quickly), the tumor suppressor genes will step in and try to fix the problem.	tumor suppressor genes	Using an analogy, explain tumor suppressor genes to a business student.
Tumor suppressor genes can be thought of as the "police force" of the body. They help to prevent tumors from forming by repairing damaged DNA and stopping cancer cells from growing and dividing.	tumor suppressor genes	Using an analogy, explain tumor suppressor genes to a business student.
Tumor suppressor genes are like the brakes on a car. They help to keep cancer from developing by slowing down or stopping the growth of tumors.	tumor suppressor genes	Using an analogy, explain tumor suppressor genes to a business student.
If you think of software as a bridge, then brittle software would be one that is easily damaged and cannot withstand much pressure. It might break when people step on it or when it's hit by a car. In comparison, robust software would be like a sturdy bridge that can handle heavy traffic and lots of pedestrians without breaking.	brittle software	Using an analogy, explain brittle software to a business student.
Brittle software is like a block of ice. It may look strong and durable from a distance, but it’s actually quite fragile. If you try to handle it too roughly or use too much force, it will break apart. In the same way, brittle software can be easily damaged by even minor errors or changes in its environment.	brittle software	Using an analogy, explain brittle software to a business student.
Brittle software is like an old, rusty car. It was once reliable but now it's prone to breaking down with little warning. The company that created it has long since gone out of business, so there's no one to fix it.	brittle software	Using an analogy, explain brittle software to a business student.
Resonance hybrid is very similar to a normal hybrid car. They both use two different forms of energy to power the car. A resonance hybrid, like a regular hybrid car, uses gasoline and electricity. The gasoline powers the car when it is started, and then once it is going, the electric motor takes over. This helps save on gas because you are not using as much gas to run the engine.	resonance hybrid	Using an analogy, explain resonance hybrid to a business student.
A resonance hybrid is a molecule that is made up of atoms from more than one element. The atoms are held together by chemical bonds. The different types of atom in the molecules can be in different states, called energy levels. When a molecule is formed, the atoms will all try to get into the lowest energy state possible. This means that some of the atoms may have to change their state. In a resonance hybrid, there are more than one way for the atoms to get into the lowest energy state. This means that there are more than one way for the molecule to bond together.	resonance hybrid	Using an analogy, explain resonance hybrid to a business student.
A resonance hybrid is a molecule that is composed of two or more atoms that are held together by covalent bonds. These atoms can be different elements, and they will share one or more pairs of electrons to form the bond. The molecules will have a stable configuration when all of the electron pairs are shared equally between the atoms. However, if an atom has more than eight electrons in its outer shell, it will attempt to share them with another atom in order to achieve a stable configuration. This process is called resonance. When this occurs, the electron pairs will move around until they are evenly distributed among all of the atoms involved in the resonance hybrid.	resonance hybrid	Using an analogy, explain resonance hybrid to a business student.
The wave mechanical model is similar to the way waves travel through water. Just as a wave in the ocean can cause a ripple of movement that travels away from where it began, an electron in an atom can create a "ripple" of motion that spreads out through the atom.	wave mechanical model	Using an analogy, explain wave mechanical model to a business student.
In the wave mechanical model, particles are seen as waves that travel through a medium. The wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks in the wave, and the frequency is how many waves pass by in a given amount of time. This model can be used to help explain how molecules move and interact with each other.	wave mechanical model	Using an analogy, explain wave mechanical model to a business student.
The wave-mechanical model of a molecule is analogous to the vibrational modes of a violin string. Just as different strings on a violin can be plucked to produce different notes, so too can the various molecular vibrations be excited to produce different spectral lines.	wave mechanical model	Using an analogy, explain wave mechanical model to a business student.

DNA replication can be thought of as a business process that produces multiple copies of an original document. The DNA molecule is the original document, and the individual strands of DNA are each copy. The process of DNA replication begins when an enzyme called helicase unwinds the double helix into two single strands. Another enzyme, polymerase, then joins new nucleotides to the exposed bases on each strand, creating two identical copies of the original DNA molecule.	dna replication	Using an analogy, explain dna replication to a business student.
DNA replication can be described as the process of creating an exact copy of a DNA molecule. The business student analogy would be making two copies of a document - one for the file cabinet and one for your desk.	dna replication	Using an analogy, explain dna replication to a business student.
DNA replication can be thought of as a process in which a company makes an exact copy of its own business records. The original set of business documents is used to create two identical sets of records. This ensures that the company has an accurate backup if anything happens to the original set of documents.	dna replication	Using an analogy, explain dna replication to a business student.
Rna transcription is the process of creating rna molecules from dna. This process is similar to how a business creates products from raw materials. The dna is like the raw material, and the rna is like the product that is created.	rna transcription	Using an analogy, explain rna transcription to a business student.
Rna transcription is the process of making a copy of a gene's rna sequence. This can be done by using an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to create a complementary dna (cDNA) molecule from the rna template. The cDNA can then be used to make a protein	rna transcription	Using an analogy, explain rna transcription to a business student.
RNA transcription can be thought of as the process of making a copy of a document. The original document is represented by the DNA sequence, and the copy is represented by the RNA sequence.	rna transcription	Using an analogy, explain rna transcription to a business student.
In business, it is important to have a clear understanding of the goals that need to be achieved and the steps that are necessary in order to achieve them. Just as with any process, there needs to be a plan in place for translating protein sequences into functioning proteins. The first step is assembling the correct set of genetic instructions (the mRNA sequence) which will dictate how the new protein should look. Once this has been determined, special enzymes called ribosomes can start reading the sequence and building the new protein molecule one amino acid at a time. Like putting together a puzzle, each piece must fit perfectly in order for the chain to be complete. If something goes wrong along the way, it could lead to defective or improperly functioning proteins.	protein translation	Using an analogy, explain protein translation to a business student.
Protein translation is similar to a business process. The genetic code in DNA is like the business plan, and the ribosomes are like the factory workers who turn that plan into a product. The mRNA is like the assembly instructions, telling the workers which parts to use and how to put them together.	protein translation	Using an analogy, explain protein translation to a business student.
A protein is like a sentence. The mRNA is like the text that the sentence is written in. The ribosomes are like the printers, and the proteins are like the final product that comes out of the printer.	protein translation	Using an analogy, explain protein translation to a business student.
An ecosystem can be thought of as a group of businesses that interact with one another to create a product or service. The businesses in the ecosystem might produce components for the product or service, market the finished product or service, and/or support the businesses involved in other ways. In order for the ecosystem to work effectively, each business must play its part and cooperate with the others.	ecosystem	Using an analogy, explain ecosystem to a business student.
An ecosystem is like a business. It has many different parts that all work together to create something larger than the sum of its individual parts. The different parts of an ecosystem include producers, consumers, and decomposers. Producers are like businesses that create products or services. Consumers are like customers who buy products or services from producers. And decomposers are like employees who recycle unused materials back into the system. Just as in a business, each part of an ecosystem plays an important role in keeping it functioning properly.	ecosystem	Using an analogy, explain ecosystem to a business student.
An ecosystem can be thought of as a stable, self-regulating web of relationships between the living things in an area and their physical environment. The sun provides energy to all life on Earth, while water and air are essential for life. Plants use sunlight to produce food through photosynthesis, which animals eat or consume. Decomposers break down dead plants and animals, providing nutrients that recycle back into the ecosystem. In this way, everything is connected in an intricate balance that sustains life. Businesses can think of themselves as ecosystems too – they have inputs (resources), outputs (products/services), customers, and employees that interact with each other to create something larger than the sum of its parts. Like natural ecosystems, businesses must find a balance among these different elements or they will not survive over time.	ecosystem	Using an analogy, explain ecosystem to a business student.
As an action potential travels down a neuron, it is similar to how word-of-mouth spreads through a business. The action potential starts with a small group of people (nerve cells) and as it spreads, the message becomes louder and more intense. Eventually, the entire company (or brain) knows about the initial message.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Using an analogy, explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron to a business student.
When an action potential is generated at the nerve cell body, it travels down the axon to the synaptic terminals. There, it causes neurotransmitters to be released into the synapse. These neurotransmitters cross the synaptic gap and bind to receptors on the next neuron, causing another action potential. This process continues until the message reaches its target muscle or organ.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Using an analogy, explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron to a business student.
The action potential is like an electric current that travels down a neuron. The business student would be like the battery, providing the energy for the current to flow. The action potential starts at the cell body and travels down the axon to the synapse. At the synapse, it causes neurotransmitters to release from the presynaptic neuron into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, causing it to generate its own action potentials.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Using an analogy, explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron to a business student.
The frog's breathing mechanism is a little different from humans. They use their skin to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide. This means that they need to be in water or moist environments for their skin to work properly. When they are out of the water, they will breathe through their mouths like we do.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Using an analogy, explain breathing mechanism of frogs to a business student.
A frog's breathing mechanism is similar to a business student's breathing mechanism. The frog takes in oxygen through its lungs and then circulates the oxygenated blood throughout its body. The business student takes in oxygen through his or her nose and mouth, and then circulates the oxygenated blood throughout his or her body.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Using an analogy, explain breathing mechanism of frogs to a business student.
When you breathe in, your lungs take in oxygen from the air. The oxygen is then transported throughout your body via your bloodstream. When you breathe out, carbon dioxide from your blood is released back into the air. Frogs have a similar breathing mechanism; when they inhale, their lungs absorb oxygen from the water and when they exhale, carbon dioxide is released back into the water.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Using an analogy, explain breathing mechanism of frogs to a business student.
Layered architecture is like a layer cake. The bottom layer is the foundation and it supports the rest of the layers. The next layer is made up of the framework and it provides basic functionality for the application. Next are the business components, which provide specific features for the application. Finally, there are the user interface components, which allow users to interact with the application.	layered architecture	Using an analogy, explain layered architecture to a business student.
A layered architecture is a way of organizing computer systems so that the most important elements are at the top and the least important elements are at the bottom. This way, if something goes wrong with one element of the system, it doesn't take down the whole system. The different layers in a layered architecture can be described as follows: The presentation layer is responsible for displaying information to users. The business logic layer handles all of the business rules and calculations. The data access layer provides access to the underlying database. And finally, the database layer stores all of the data used by the application.	layered architecture	Using an analogy, explain layered architecture to a business student.
A layered architecture is like an onion. It has many layers, each one protecting the ones beneath it. The outermost layer is the most visible, but the inner layers are where the real work happens. In a business context, this would mean that the top layer is what customers see and interact with, while the underlying layers are responsible for things like processing transactions and managing inventory.	layered architecture	Using an analogy, explain layered architecture to a business student.
A limiting reactant is a chemical in a reaction that becomes exhausted first, and thus limits the amount of product that can be formed. An excess reactant is a chemical in a reaction that is not used up by the reaction.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Using an analogy, explain limiting reactant and excess reactant to a business student.
A limiting reactant is like a scarce resource in a company. It is the ingredient or component that is in short supply and limits the amount of product that can be made. An excess reactant is like extra resources that a company has on hand. It's not necessary for making the product, but it can help speed up the process.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Using an analogy, explain limiting reactant and excess reactant to a business student.
If a business is overproducing, it is using up more resources than are available. The limiting reactant is the resource that's being used up at the fastest rate, while the excess reactant is the resource that's not being used up as quickly.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Using an analogy, explain limiting reactant and excess reactant to a business student.
A eukaryotic cell is like a company. The nucleus is the CEO, the mitochondria are the workers, and the cytoplasm is the office space.	eukaryotic cell	Using an analogy, explain eukaryotic cell to a business student.

A prokaryotic cell can be compared to a small business. Just as the business has an owner, employees, and customers, the prokaryotic cell has a genetic material (the owner), proteins that carry out its functions (employees), and other molecules necessary for life such as water and oxygen (customers). The genes in the genetic material direct the production of proteins, which allow the cell to grow, divide, and respond to its environment.	prokaryotic cell	Using an analogy, explain prokaryotic cell to a business student.
A prokaryotic cell is like a small business. It has all of the basic components that are necessary for it to function, including a boss (the nucleus), workers (ribosomes), and customers (molecules that need to be transported into or out of the cell). Like any good business, the prokaryotic cell strives to be efficient and productive, using its resources wisely in order to survive and grow.	prokaryotic cell	Using an analogy, explain prokaryotic cell to a business student.
A prokaryotic cell is like a small business. It is relatively simple and easy to manage, has a limited amount of resources, and can only do a few things.	prokaryotic cell	Using an analogy, explain prokaryotic cell to a business student.
An operating system kernel can be likened to the engine of a car. It is the component that performs all of the low-level tasks required to keep the vehicle running, such as starting and stopping the engine, controlling fuel intake, and managing gears. In much the same way, an operating system kernel manages core functions on a computer, such as memory allocation, process management, and file systems. While it may not be directly visible to users, the kernel is essential for ensuring that a computer runs smoothly and efficiently.	operating systems kernel	Using an analogy, explain operating systems kernel to a business student.
Operating systems kernels are like the brains of a computer. They control how information is processed and handled by the system. In business, this would be equivalent to managing resources and handling communication between different parts of the company.	operating systems kernel	Using an analogy, explain operating systems kernel to a business student.
An operating system kernel is like the engine of a car. It provides basic functions that all other parts of the car rely on, such as turning the wheels and getting power to the engine. The kernel also manages resources, such as memory and CPU time, and ensures that different parts of the software can work together.	operating systems kernel	Using an analogy, explain operating systems kernel to a business student.
A limiting reactant is a chemical that limits the quantity of product that can be formed in a chemical reaction. For example, imagine you are a business student and want to start a new company. You will need some money to get started, but you also need someone to help you run your business. If you have only $500 to start your company, then the money is the limiting reactant - it will limit how much you can do with your new business.	limiting reactant	Using an analogy, explain limiting reactant to a business student.
A limiting reactant is the reactant in a chemical reaction that is used up first. The other reactants continue toreact until they are all used up. In business, a limiting reactant is like a limitedresource. Once it's gone, the company can't produce any more of that product.	limiting reactant	Using an analogy, explain limiting reactant to a business student.
A limiting reactant is the amount of a reactant that determines how much product can be formed. In other words, it's the amount of a particular chemical that will determine how much of another chemical can be produced. For example, if you have two businesses and one has twice as many workers as the other, then the first business is using up its limiting reactant faster and will produce less product than the second business.	limiting reactant	Using an analogy, explain limiting reactant to a business student.
Just as a helicase enzyme unwinds the twisted DNA strands to create replication, a business must also unravel the complexities of its organization in order to grow. The helicase enzyme is responsible for unzipping and separating the two DNA strands. In the same way, a business must identify its key areas of operation and focus on expanding these aspects in order to achieve growth.	helicase	Using an analogy, explain helicase to a business student.
 helicase is like the worker who cleans the windows of a building. They use a long, thin brush to clean the glass from top to bottom. Helicase uses its 'brush' to unwind DNA so that it can be copied accurately.	helicase	Using an analogy, explain helicase to a business student.
Helicase is a protein that helps chromosomes separate during cell division. It can be likened to the business student's favorite office tool - scissors. Just as scissors make it easy for her to cut through paper, helicase makes it easy for chromosomes to split apart.	helicase	Using an analogy, explain helicase to a business student.

They also play a role in ensuring that the correct copies of DNA are created during replication.	dna replication binding proteins	Using an analogy, explain dna replication binding proteins to a business student.
Ligase is a protein that helps to join two DNA strands together. It is the enzyme responsible for ligating, or joining, pieces of DNA. In business terms, it would be similar to the glue that binds different parts of a company together, making it stronger and more efficient.	ligase	Using an analogy, explain ligase to a business student.
Ligase is a protein that helps create covalent bonds between DNA strands. It does this by joining pieces of DNA together, creating what is called a "phosphodiester bond."

A process control block (PCB) is a collection of data that helps to ensure the quality of a product or service. The PCB contains information about the input and output parameters of a manufacturing or business process, as well as the tolerances for each parameter. By tracking the performance of each step in the process against these tolerances, it is possible to identify and correct any deviations from desired outputs.	process control block	Using an analogy, explain process control block to a business student.
A process control block is like an air traffic controller for a busy airport. The controller manages the flow of planes coming in and out of the airport, ensuring that there are no collisions. Similarly, a process control block oversees the execution of a business process, ensuring that all steps are completed without errors.	process control block	Using an analogy, explain process control block to a business student.
A control block is like a traffic light. It helps regulate the flow of information and keep everything organized.	process control block	Using an analogy, explain process control block to a business student.
Encoding a message is like putting it in a locked box. Only the person who has the key can unlock and read the message. The encoding process makes it difficult for someone else to figure out what the message says.	message encoding	Using an analogy, explain message encoding to a business student.
Message encoding is the process of transforming a message into a format that can be transmitted over a communication channel. The message is first divided into blocks, and each block is assigned a code. The codes are then transmitted in sequence over the communication channel. At the receiving end, the codes are transformed back into blocks, and the blocks are assembled into the original message.	message encoding	Using an analogy, explain message encoding to a business student.
Messages can be thought of as packages that are sent from one person to another. The package may contain anything the sender wishes, such as a letter, a gift, or money. To send the package, the sender needs to put it in an envelope and address it to the recipient. Inside the envelope, the sender also needs to include postage so that the package can be delivered.Just like mailing a package, sending a message requires encoding it in a specific format so that it can be understood by the recipient. In business contexts, this usually means translating clear and concise language into abbreviations, acronyms, and code words that are commonly used within that industry or company. Doing this ensures that all employees are speaking the same language when discussing various topics and projects.	message encoding	Using an analogy, explain message encoding to a business student.
Drugs and receptor sites interact in a manner similar to that of two business people negotiating the sale of a product. The drug is the product being offered, while the receptor site is the potential customer. In order for there to be an effective interaction, both parties must be willing to communicate and reach an agreement. The drug must attach itself to the receptor site in order to exert its effects, just as the seller must make an offer that is acceptable to the buyer. If either party is unwilling or unable to participate in this exchange, then no transaction will take place.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Using an analogy, explain interaction between drugs and receptor sites to a business student.
Receptor sites are like employees in a business. The drugs are like the customers that come into the store. The more customers that come into the store, the busier the employees get. The more active the receptor site is, the more likely it is to bind with a drug molecule.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Using an analogy, explain interaction between drugs and receptor sites to a business student.
If you think of receptors as being like locks on a door, then drugs can be thought of as keys. The drug is the key that unlocks the receptor site so that it can do its job. In order for the drug to work properly, it needs to fit into the receptor site perfectly like a key in a lock. If the drug doesn't fit quite right, it may not unlock the receptor and thus won't have any effect.	interaction between drugs and receptor sites	Using an analogy, explain interaction between drugs and receptor sites to a business student.

Glycolysis can be thought of as the process that a business uses to turn inputs, such as raw materials and labor, into outputs, such as finished products. The business starts by breaking down the inputs into their component parts in order to use them more efficiently. It then assembles the components into something new and useful. Finally, it sells the product to customers who will use it to meet their own needs.	glycolysis	Using an analogy, explain glycolysis to a business student.
Glycolysis is like when a business starts making a profit. The business has started to convert its inputs (money) into outputs (products and services).

The glycolytic pathway can be used by both aerobic and anaerobic organisms to generate energy.	glycolysis	Using an analogy, explain glycolysis to a business student.
Anti-stokes scattering is much like what happens when one throws a rock into a still pond. The energy from the thrown rock creates waves that ripple outward until they dissipate. The anti-stokes process is similar, but instead of a rock being thrown into water, it's an electron that's kicked out of its atom. These ejected electrons create radiation that spreads out until it eventually peters out.	anti-stokes scattering	Using an analogy, explain anti-stokes scattering to a business student.
Anti-Stokes scattering is a type of Raman scattering that occurs when the energy of the photons being scattered is greater than the energy of the incident photons. In other words, it is a process by which light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation are scattered by molecules in such a way that their energy level decreases. This phenomenon can be useful for studying molecular structure and dynamics, as well as detecting signatures of specific chemical species.	anti-stokes scattering	Using an analogy, explain anti-stokes scattering to a business student.
Anti-Stokes scattering is the process of a photon bouncing off an atom and being emitted in a different direction. This happens when the photon has more energy than the atom it is scattering off of. To a business student, anti-stokes scattering can be best explained as the opposite of how stokes scattering works. With stokes scattering, photons lose energy as they bounce off atoms and are then absorbed by other atoms. In anti-stokes scattering, photons gain energy as they bounce off atoms and are then emitted by other atoms.	anti-stokes scattering	Using an analogy, explain anti-stokes scattering to a business student.
Stokes scattering is the process by which light or other particles are scattered by collisions with gas molecules. This scatter can be thought of as a randomizing process that causes photons to lose their coherency, much like how people in a crowd lose their individuality. The amount of scatter depends on the wavelength of the light and the density of the gas.	stokes scattering	Using an analogy, explain stokes scattering to a business student.
Stokes scattering is similar to the way sunlight reflects off of a mirror. When light hits a mirror, some of the light is reflected off the surface and some is absorbed by the mirror. The light that is reflected off the surface travels in a straight line until it hits another object and is then reflected again. This process continues until the light reaches its destination or is absorbed by something else.	stokes scattering	Using an analogy, explain stokes scattering to a business student.
When light waves travel through the atmosphere, they sometimes encounter air molecules. These collisions cause the light waves to scatter in all directions. This type of scattering is called stokes scattering.	stokes scattering	Using an analogy, explain stokes scattering to a business student.

For example, if a business student wanted to know how harmful a certain chemical was, they could look up its LD50 value.	median lethal dose	Using an analogy, explain median lethal dose to a business student.
The median lethal dose is the amount of a substance that will kill half of a population of test animals. In business, it can be seen as the point at which a company begins to experience negative consequences from its actions. For example, if a company produces too much pollution, it will reach the median lethal dose and begin to cause significant damage to the environment.	median lethal dose	Using an analogy, explain median lethal dose to a business student.
The median lethal dose (LD50) is the dosage of a toxin that kills 50% of the test population. It can be used as a measure of the toxicity of a substance.

The universe can be thought of as a business. It is constantly expanding and evolving, with new businesses being created while others go out of business. The universe is also unpredictable, with unexpected events happening all the time. However, there are some things that remain constant, such as the laws of supply and demand. In order to succeed in the universe (business), one must be adaptable and able to change with the times.	universe	Using an analogy, explain universe to a business student.
Enzymes are like workers in a factory. They do the work of converting one molecule into another. The molecules they convert are called substrates. The enzyme binds to the substrate and then converts it into the product. Enzyme activity can be affected by things like temperature and pH levels.	enzyme mechanism	Using an analogy, explain enzyme mechanism to a business student.
Enzymes are like tiny machines that help chemical reactions happen in the body. They work by fitting into a specific spot on a molecule and helping it to change shape so that the reaction can happen. This is kind of like how a wrench fits into a bolt to help turn it, but enzymes are much smaller than wrenches!	enzyme mechanism	Using an analogy, explain enzyme mechanism to a business student.
Enzyme mechanisms are like machines in a factory. The enzymes are the workers and the molecules they work on are the products. The factories need energy to run, just as enzymes need energy to function. The products of the factory have to be packaged and labeled before they can be sold, just as the molecules produced by enzymes have to be processed and put into proper form before they can be used by the body.	enzyme mechanism	Using an analogy, explain enzyme mechanism to a business student.
An ANOVA is used to test the equality of means between groups. For example, if a business wanted to know if there was a difference in satisfaction ratings among customers who purchased products from its online store and customers who purchased products from its brick-and-mortar store, it could use an ANOVA to test for this difference.	anova	Using an analogy, explain anova to a business student.
An ANOVA is a test of whether there are any statistically significant differences among the means of three or more groups. It's like taking a bunch of samples from those groups and seeing if the averages of the samples in each group are really different from one another.	anova	Using an analogy, explain anova to a business student.
Anova is a statistical technique used to test the difference between the means of two or more groups. It stands for "analysis of variance."	anova	Using an analogy, explain anova to a business student.
A thermostat is a device used to regulate the temperature of a room or building. It does this by sensing the temperature and turning on or off heating or cooling appliances as needed. In business, a thermostat can be thought of as a tool used to manage risk. By monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs), a company can detect early signs of trouble and make necessary adjustments before things spiral out of control.	thermostat	Using an analogy, explain thermostat to a business student.
A thermostat is a device that helps regulate the temperature in a room or building. It does this by turning on or off the heating or cooling system as needed. In business, a thermostat can be seen as something that regulates and maintains the stability of a company. For example, if sales are down, the thermostat will turn on the marketing department to try and increase sales. If expenses are too high, the thermostat will turn on the finance department to cut costs.	thermostat	Using an analogy, explain thermostat to a business student.
A thermostat is a device that controls the temperature of a room by regulating the amount of heat or air conditioning entering or leaving the room. It does this by turning on and off either the heating or cooling unit depending on the temperature set on the thermostat. In business, a thermostat could be used to metaphorically describe someone who manages and regulates company expenses in order to maintain a certain budget.	thermostat	Using an analogy, explain thermostat to a business student.
Chemical equilibrium is similar to a business that has reached its break-even point. At this point, the company is no longer losing money, but it is also not making any profits. In the same way, chemical equilibrium describes a state in which the concentrations of reactants and products are equal.	chemical equilibrium	Using an analogy, explain chemical equilibrium to a business student.
Chemical equilibrium is much like a business that has reached its optimal state. In this analogy, the chemicals in a solution are like the employees of the business. The chemical reactions taking place in the solution are analogous to the processes going on within the company. Just as too many or too few employees can throw off the balance of a business, an imbalance in chemical concentrations can upset equilibrium.	chemical equilibrium	Using an analogy, explain chemical equilibrium to a business student.
Chemical equilibrium is like a business that has been in operation for many years. The company has reached a point where it is no longer making a profit, and it must make changes to continue operations. If the company does not make any changes, it will eventually go out of business. However, if the company makes small adjustments to its products or services, it can stay afloat and continue to thrive.	chemical equilibrium	Using an analogy, explain chemical equilibrium to a business student.
Just-in-time is a philosophy or strategy for organizing production and inventory. The goal of just-in-time is to reduce waste by producing only what is needed, when it is needed. This can be accomplished by having a streamlined process with minimal buffers (extra inventory) between stages.	just-in-time	Using an analogy, explain just-in-time to a business student.
Just-in-time is a business strategy that strives to improve efficiency and decrease waste by receiving goods only as they are needed. The goal is to receive the right amount of inventory at the right time so there is no excess or shortage.	just-in-time	Using an analogy, explain just-in-time to a business student.
Just-in-time is an inventory management system that aims to reduce the amount of time a company spends stocking up on inventory. The philosophy behind just-in-time is that companies should only order and produce items when they are needed. This reduces the need for storage space and allows businesses to focus on producing what their customers want, rather than guessing what might sell well.	just-in-time	Using an analogy, explain just-in-time to a business student.
Adaptive immunity can be thought of as a company’s immune system. The body’s immune system is constantly working to protect the body from harmful invaders such as bacteria and viruses. The immune system does this by producing antibodies which are proteins that attach to the invading organisms and destroy them. Adaptive immunity is similar in that it also produces antibodies, but these antibodies are specific to particular threats, such as cancer cells or snake venom. Additionally, adaptive immunity is able to remember past threats and quickly produce antibodies if it encounters that threat again. This allows the body to mount a rapid response against previously encountered threats. Just like the human immune system, adaptive immunity is always on guard and working hard to protect its host (the business).	adaptive immunity	Using an analogy, explain adaptive immunity to a business student.
Adaptive immunity can be thought of as the immune system's ability to "learn" and remember specific infections. This allows the body to mount a more rapid and effective defense against future infection by that same pathogen. In contrast, innate immunity is more like a "default" response that is not necessarily tailored to any particular pathogen.	adaptive immunity	Using an analogy, explain adaptive immunity to a business student.
Adaptive immunity can be thought of as a company’s immune system. The body’s natural defenses – adaptive immunity – recognize and remember specific infections, so that the next time the person is infected, they are better equipped to fight off the infection. For businesses, this means having systems in place to protect against attacks and learning from past mistakes so that future attacks are less likely to succeed.	adaptive immunity	Using an analogy, explain adaptive immunity to a business student.
Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the potential difference across the two points. In other words, if you increase the voltage (or potential difference), then you will also increase the amount of current flowing through the conductor.	ohm's law	Using an analogy, explain ohm's law to a business student.
Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the potential difference across the points. In other words, if you apply more voltage (potential difference) to one end of a wire, then more current will flow through it. This is like saying that if you put more pressure on one side of a hose pipe than the other, water will flow faster out of the higher-pressure side.	ohm's law	Using an analogy, explain ohm's law to a business student.
If you think of electricity as water, then ohm's law is like a rule that governs how much water flows through a pipe. The amount of current (water flow) in a circuit is directly proportional to the voltage (pressure) and inversely proportional to the resistance. In other words, if you increase the voltage or decrease the resistance, then the current will increase. And if you decrease the voltage or increase the resistance, then the current will decrease.	ohm's law	Using an analogy, explain ohm's law to a business student.
Transcription is the process of taking spoken words and converting them into written form. This can be done either by a human or a computer. Transcription is used in many different businesses, including medical transcription, legal transcription, and financial transcription.	transcription	Using an analogy, explain transcription to a business student.
Transcription is the process of converting spoken language into a written form. In business, transcription can be important for taking meeting minutes or recording interviews.	transcription	Using an analogy, explain transcription to a business student.
Transcription is like taking dictation. The transcriptionist listens to someone speaking and types what they are saying.	transcription	Using an analogy, explain transcription to a business student.
RNA polymerase is like a secretary in a business. The secretary takes notes of what the boss says and then types it up into a formal document. RNA polymerase does the same thing with DNA - it copies the genetic instructions from DNA to RNA.	rna polymerase	Using an analogy, explain rna polymerase to a business student.
RNA polymerase can be thought of as the CEO of a company. It is responsible for making sure that all aspects of the business are running smoothly and that important tasks are completed on time. In addition, it coordinates communication between different parts of the company.	rna polymerase	Using an analogy, explain rna polymerase to a business student.
RNA polymerase is like the assembly line worker at a car factory. The RNA polymerase reads the instructions for building a car (the DNA) and assembles it piece by piece.	rna polymerase	Using an analogy, explain rna polymerase to a business student.
Ribosomes are the "factories" of the cell. They are responsible for making all of the proteins that the cell needs to function. The ribosomes read a set of instructions (called a gene) and use those instructions to build a protein.	ribosome	Using an analogy, explain ribosome to a business student.
Ribosomes are the protein factories of cells. They read the genetic code in DNA to create proteins, which are essential for life.	ribosome	Using an analogy, explain ribosome to a business student.
A ribosome is like a factory that manufactures proteins. The DNA in the nucleus provides the instructions for constructing each protein, and the ribosomes read these instructions and assemble the proteins.	ribosome	Using an analogy, explain ribosome to a business student.
Activator protein can be thought of as the CEO of a company. It is responsible for activating other proteins, which then go on to perform essential tasks required for the functioning of the cell. Without activator protein, these other proteins would not be able to do their job, and the cell would not function properly.	activator protein	Using an analogy, explain activator protein to a business student.
Activator protein is like the CEO of a company. It is responsible for getting things done and making sure that everything runs smoothly.	activator protein	Using an analogy, explain activator protein to a business student.
Activator protein can be thought of as the CEO of a company. This protein is responsible for initiating and regulating gene transcription—the process by which genetic information is converted into proteins. Without activator protein, genes would not be able to produce the proteins necessary for cellular function and survival.	activator protein	Using an analogy, explain activator protein to a business student.
An electric circuit is like a water pipe. Electricity flows through the wires in much the same way that water flows through a pipe. Just as there are valves to control the flow of water, there are switches to control the flow of electricity.	electric circuit	Using an analogy, explain electric circuit to a business student.
Electricity flows through a closed loop known as an electric circuit. The electricity enters the system at one point and makes its way around to the starting point, completing the circuit. In order for the electricity to flow, there must be a complete path for it to follow. This is similar to how business works - there must be a clear path for money (electricity) to move in order for transactions to take place.	electric circuit	Using an analogy, explain electric circuit to a business student.
Electricity is like water in a pipe. The current (flow of electricity) through the wire is like the flow of water through a pipe. Voltage (pressure of electricity) is like the pressure of water in a pipe. Resistance to the flow of electric current is like resistance to the flow of water in a pipe.	electric circuit	Using an analogy, explain electric circuit to a business student.
The hydrophobic effect is the tendency of nonpolar molecules to aggregate in an aqueous environment. In other words, it's the natural inclination of oil to stick together and avoid water. This occurs because water molecules are polar and can interact with other polar molecules, whereas nonpolar molecules don't have any charges that would allow them to interact with other molecules. So when you mix oil and water, the oil droplets will try to get away from the water as much as possible by clumping together.	hydrophobic effect	Using an analogy, explain hydrophobic effect to a business student.
The hydrophobic effect is the tendency of nonpolar molecules to aggregate in an aqueous environment. In essence, this means that oil and water will not mix because the oil (a nonpolar molecule) is repelled by the water (a polar molecule). This effect can be seen when you try to shake a bottle of salad dressing that has been sitting on your counter for a while - even after vigorous shaking, there will still be some oil left on top.	hydrophobic effect	Using an analogy, explain hydrophobic effect to a business student.
The hydrophobic effect is the physical phenomenon that causes nonpolar molecules to aggregate in an aqueous environment. In other words, it's the force that makes oil and water mix together less than they would if they were both polar. This happens because the hydrocarbon chains of nonpolar molecules repel water, while polar molecules interact with it strongly. Think about it this way: oil is like a group of people who don't want to get wet (hydrophobic), while water is like a group of people who love getting wet (hydrophilic). When you put them together, the people who don't want to get wet push away from the people who do, causing them to mix together less than if everyone liked getting wet.	hydrophobic effect	Using an analogy, explain hydrophobic effect to a business student.
Biological signal transduction can be thought of as a business process. The input is the biological signal, such as a hormone or neurotransmitter, and the output is the effect of that signal on cells, tissues, or organs. Like any good business process, there needs to be some kind of feedback mechanism to ensure that the output matches the input. In biology, this feedback comes in the form of receptors on cell surfaces that detect changes in their environment and relay that information inside the cell. This triggers a series of biochemical reactions that culminate in an alteration in cellular function.	biological signal transduction	Using an analogy, explain biological signal transduction to a business student.
Biological signal transduction can be thought of as the process that allows a business to receive a customer's order and then act on it. The customer's order is the biological signal, and the actions that are taken in response to the order are known as the transducer function. In businesses, this might mean taking an order over the phone and then preparing and delivering the food to the customer's house.	biological signal transduction	Using an analogy, explain biological signal transduction to a business student.
In the business world, a signal is an indication of something important happening. For example, when a company's stock price suddenly changes, that's a signal that something has happened to affect the value of the stock.The same thing happens with biological signals: they're indications that something important is happening in the body. When hormones like insulin start flowing through your bloodstream after you eat a meal, for example, that's a signal telling your cells to start digesting food.Biological signals are transmitted by proteins called receptors. These receptors sit on the surface of cells and wait for specific molecules (the signals) to attach themselves to them. When this happens, it triggers a series of chemical reactions inside the cell that ultimately lead to some kind of cellular response.	biological signal transduction	Using an analogy, explain biological signal transduction to a business student.
