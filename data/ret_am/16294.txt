Reinforcement <b>learning</b> provides a clean, simple language to state general AI problems. In reinforcement <b>learning</b>, there is a set of actions, a set of observations and a reward. The goal in reinforcement <b>learning</b> is to learn a policy which is a function of the observations, the rewards and the actions, and which maps histories to actions so as to ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-02-01T15:54:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], [{"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.0", "name": "Introduction - TUM Wiki-System - Wiki-System - TUM Wiki", "url": "https://wiki.tum.de/display/lfdv/Introduction", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://wiki.tum.de/display/lfdv/Introduction", "snippet": "<b>Reinforcement learning (RL) can be compared to</b> the <b>learning</b> method of humans.
