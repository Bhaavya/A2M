Introduction. The best way to understand something is to try and explain it. And if you keep getting better every time you try to explain it, well, that\u2019s roughly the gist of what Reinforcement <b>Learning</b> (RL) is about. Given how different RL is from Supervised or Unsupervised <b>Learning</b>, I figured that the best strategy is to go slow, and to go slow is to start with the <b>Markov</b> assumption, introduce the concept of a scalar reward and build into <b>Markov</b> Reward Processes (MRPs).Then, once our ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-02-01T06:47:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.8", "name": "Is life just <b>a Markov</b> decision process? - Quora", "url": "https://www.quora.com/Is-life-just-a-Markov-decision-process", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.quora.com/Is-life-just-<b>a-Markov</b>-decision-process", "snippet": "Answer (1 of 6): Yes it is, you <b>can</b> predict the state of the universe at time t from knowing everything about time t-1.
