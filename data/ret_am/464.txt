However, from a recent report, it turned out that nonstatic waves can also appear in a static environment where the electromagnetic parameters of the medium do not vary in time. Such waves in Fock states exhibit a belly and a node in turn periodically in the graphic of their evolution. This is due to the wave expansion and collapse in quadrature space, which manifest a unique nonstaticity of the wave.
