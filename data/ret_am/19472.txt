The mechanism of eukaryotic <b>DNA replication is similar</b> to that of prokaryotic DNA replication. However, eukaryotic DNA replication requires special consideration due to differences in DNA sizes, unique linear DNA end structures called telomeres, and distinctive DNA packaging that involves complexes with histones.Unlike prokaryotes, most eukaryotes are multicellular organisms ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-02-03T03:39:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.4", "name": "Comparing &amp; Contrasting <b>DNA Replication</b> in Prokaryotes &amp; Eukaryotes ...", "url": "https://sciencing.com/comparing-contrasting-dna-replication-prokaryotes-eukaryotes-13739.html", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://sciencing.com/comparing-contrasting-<b>dna-replication</b>-prokaryotes-eukaryotes...", "snippet": "Both types of organisms also follow a pattern called semi-conservative replication.
