A DNN that recognizes a cat can be thought of as a function whose domain is pictures and range is the set . Same with DNNs that predict anything. For (relatively) simple tasks the function that we want to model with our DNN is clear, but there are many cases where its ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-08T06:44:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.6", "name": "Dark control: The default mode network as a reinforcement <b>learning</b> ...", "url": "https://europepmc.org/article/MED/32500968", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://europepmc.org/article/MED/32500968", "snippet": "For instance, a simple linear model with a kernel \u03d5 would be of the form \u02dc Q (s, a \u2223 \u03b8) = \u03d5 (s, a) T \u03b8 Q \u02dc s, a \u2223 \u03b8 = \u03d5 s, a T \u03b8, where \u03d5(s, a) would represent a high\u2010level representation of the state\u2010action pairs (s, a), as was previously proposed (Song, Parr, Liao, &amp; Carin, 2016), or artificial neural\u2010network models as demonstrated in seminal <b>machine</b>\u2010<b>learning</b> models (Mnih et al., 2015; Silver et al., 2016) for playing complex games (atari, Go, etc.) at super\u2010human ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-03-21T20:33:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.7", "name": "<b>Intrinsically Motivated Learning of Hierarchical Collections</b> of Skills", "url": "https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~baveja/Papers/Barto-Singh-Chentanezfinal.pdf", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~baveja/Papers/Barto-Singh-Chentanezfinal.pdf", "snippet": "RL is a very active area of <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b>, with con-siderable attention also being received from decision the-ory, operations research, and control engineering.
