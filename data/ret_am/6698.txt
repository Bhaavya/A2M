Because this assessment can be performed over the ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-12-24T18:43:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.2", "name": "IJGI | Free Full-Text | Dasymetric Mapping and Spatial Modeling of ...", "url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/3/3/891/htm", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/3/3/891/htm", "snippet": "Complex biophysical, social, and human behavioral factors influence population vulnerability to vector-borne diseases.
