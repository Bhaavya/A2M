The motivation behind <b>AdaGrad is similar</b> to that of AROW (Section 6.4), using second-order covariance statistics \u03a3 to adjust the <b>learning</b> rate of individual parameters based on their update frequency. If we define the SGD gradient as for notational simplicity, the update rule for AdaGrad can be expressed as follows.
