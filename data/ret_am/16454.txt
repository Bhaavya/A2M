In-vivo data decompositions. For real data, we decomposed group-average tractography matrices, using independent component analysis (ICA) and non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF), with a range of model orders K. ICA was initialised with regular PCA, in which the first 500 components were retained (explaining 97% of the total variance). ICA was applied to the reduced dataset using the FastICA algorithm (Hyv\u00e4rinen and ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-10-11T05:11:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.3", "name": "(PDF) <b>Sparse Representations for Text Categorization</b> | Dimitri Kanevsky ...", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2738730/Sparse_Representations_for_Text_Categorization", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.academia.edu/2738730/<b>Sparse_Representations_for_Text_Categorization</b>", "snippet": "A Comparative Study of <b>Machine</b> <b>Learning</b> Methods for Verbal Autopsy Text Classification.
