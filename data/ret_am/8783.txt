I <b>thought</b> I need to learn Nonlinear Regression. Reply. Jim Frost says. July 12, 2021 at 5:27 pm . Hi Yujin, The naming <b>can</b> be confusing! Nonlinear regression <b>can</b> fit a wider variety of <b>curve</b> shapes but often linear regression <b>can</b> fit your <b>curve</b>. I always recommend starting with linear regression because it\u2019s easier and see if that works for your data. Reply. Julian says. May 20, 2021 at 5:57 am.
