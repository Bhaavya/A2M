The job of this is to make a choice between minimizing loss and regularizing the model. Because of the scale of these two numbers being different, it is sensible to actually weigh them differently. Initially, they didn\u2019t do it and weren\u2019t getting good performance, but later thought that if they could create a weighted model, that might do the trick.
