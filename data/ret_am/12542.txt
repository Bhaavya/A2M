Then, an activation is applied to this sum. The neuron then sends this value as its output. We can then represent our 2 layer model with the figure below: You can think of the two sets of arrows as the two weight matrices \\(W_1\\) and \\(W_2\\). This interpretation of the model draws analogies with how the brain ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-12-12T05:11:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], []], "all_bing_queries": ["+(dense layer)  is like +(brick wall)", "+(dense layer) is similar to +(brick wall)", "+(dense layer) can be thought of as +(brick wall)", "+(dense layer) can be compared to +(brick wall)", "machine learning +(dense layer AND analogy)", "machine learning +(\"dense layer is like\")", "machine learning +(\"dense layer is similar\")", "machine learning +(\"just as dense layer\")", "machine learning +(\"dense layer can be thought of as\")", "machine learning +(\"dense layer can be compared to\")"]}
