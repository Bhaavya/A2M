Why might a cell make a lot of rRNA but only one copy of DNA? Cells might make lots of rRNA but only one copy of DNA because rRNA is a component of ribosomes, and many ribosomes are needed to keep up with the evil of protein synthesis needed by a cell. However, each cell needs only one set of DNA so it is ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-04-13T21:08:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.8", "name": "EAGER: <b>Collaborative Research: Data Science Applications</b> In ...", "url": "https://cps-vo.org/node/42479", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://cps-vo.org/node/42479", "snippet": "National <b>Science</b> Foundation: Award Number: 1701292: 379 Reads.

Abstract: A cyberphysical system (CPS) in biology requires sensor input that represents, as closely as possible, cell activity. Much work is expended on the development of wearable sensors that detect the expression of cell activity filtered through many processes.
