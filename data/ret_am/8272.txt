Q. What does this document have to offer that experienced education policy-makers don&#39;t already know? A. Experienced policy-makers certainly bring a great deal of skill to security policy development. But in many ways, security policy is different from other forms of more traditional policy--it requires policy-makers to think like data entry clerks, MIS staff, research and evaluation specialists, legal counsel, building administrators, teachers, and so on.
