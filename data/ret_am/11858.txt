Point-like similarity measure. Point-like similarity measure refers to the first level of the proposed multilevel similarity model. Due to the fact that most of the existing registration methods utilize the apparent keypoint properties (e.g., local descriptors, scales and orientations) for establishing the keypoint matches, there are numerous keypoints that have different physical sizes available in the keypoint matching procedure, and then false matches are produced.", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-02-03T00:08:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.4", "name": "AP-10K: NeurIPS 2021 Datasets and Benchmarks Track", "url": "https://gitee.com/giteebob/AP-10K", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://gitee.com/giteebob/AP-10K", "snippet": "NeurIPS 2021 Datasets and Benchmarks Track", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-26T14:42:00.0000000Z", "language": "zh_chs", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.5", "name": "PAPER Special Issue on <b>Machine</b> Vision and its Applications Recognition ...", "url": "http://www.am.sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp/~mansur/files/IEICE_special.pdf", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "www.am.sanken.osaka-u.ac.jp/~mansur/files/IEICE_special.pdf", "snippet": "PAPER Special Issue on <b>Machine</b> Vision and its Applications Recognition of Plain Objects Using Local Region Matching Al MANSUR , Katsutoshi SAKATA , Dipankar DAS , Nonmembers, and Yoshinori KUNO , Member SUMMARY Conventional interest point based matching re-quires computationally expensive patch preprocessing and is not appropriate for plain objects with negligible detail.
