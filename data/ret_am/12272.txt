In this method, subsequent tasks are trained using the inactive neurons and filters of the sparsified network and cause zero deterioration to the performance of previous tasks. In order to deal with the possible compromise between model sparsity and performance, we formalize and incorporate the concept of graceful forgetting: the ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-11-07T10:32:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.5", "name": "Abstract - arXiv.org e-Print archive", "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.04476", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.04476", "snippet": "Continual <b>learning</b>, the ability of models to learn to solve new tasks beyond what has previously been trained, has garnered much attention from the <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b> community in recent years.
