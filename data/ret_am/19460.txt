My Yamaha P500 <b>can</b> tweak individual notes, or it <b>can</b> shift entire voices. I have one voice set a step low, for when my daughter practiced her trumpet music. Many models also <b>can</b> shift to various historical temperaments. It&#39;s also possible that for a particular chord, equal temperament grates on his ear, but I&#39;d think that would be true for many notes. Logged Tim. dcstudio.
