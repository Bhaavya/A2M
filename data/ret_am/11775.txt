Optimizing it is NP-hard. A reasonable middle-ground is the one-norm: jjwjj 1 = \u00e5 djw j. It is indeed convex: in fact, it is the tighest \u2018p norm that is convex. Moreover, its gradients do not go to zero as in the two-norm. <b>Just as hinge-loss</b> is the tightest convex upper bound on zero-one error, the one-norm is the tighest convex upper bound on the zero-norm.
