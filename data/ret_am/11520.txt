This layer introduces non-linearity in the network and enables the ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-12-04T13:32:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.8", "name": "<b>Orthogonal</b> Initialization in Convolutional Layers \u00b7 Hendrik J.
