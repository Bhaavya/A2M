A DNN that recognizes a cat can be thought of as a function whose domain is pictures and range is the set . Same with DNNs that predict anything. For (relatively) simple tasks the function that we want to model with our DNN is clear, but there are many cases where its ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-08T06:44:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.8", "name": "(PDF) <b>Intrinsically motivated learning of hierarchical collections</b> of ...", "url": "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228752859_Intrinsically_motivated_learning_of_hierarchical_collections_of_skills", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228752859_Intrinsically_motivated_<b>learning</b>_of...", "snippet": "RL is a very active area of <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b>, with con-siderable attention also being received from decision the-ory, operations research, and control engineering.
