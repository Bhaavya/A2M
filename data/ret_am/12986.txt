Besides, MTL is also related to the problem of <b>learning</b>-to-learn (LTL), which aims to perform a new task by exploiting the knowledge acquired when solving previous tasks. The capability of LTL is very similar to the ability of human being that learns from experience when performing new tasks. Hence, a solution or <b>machine</b> constructed based on LTL would have major impact in general Artificial Intelligence (AI).
