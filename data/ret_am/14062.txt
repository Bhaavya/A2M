Title: <b>Exact inference in structured prediction</b>. Authors: Kevin Bello, Jean Honorio (Submitted on 2 Jun 2019) Abstract: Structured <b>prediction can be thought of as</b> a simultaneous prediction of multiple labels. This is often done by maximizing a score function on the space of labels, which decomposes as a sum of pairwise and unary potentials. The above is naturally modeled with a graph, where edges and vertices are related to pairwise and unary potentials ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2019-07-09T17:19:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.8", "name": "(PDF) <b>Machine learning approaches and databases for prediction</b> of drug ...", "url": "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338675745_Machine_learning_approaches_and_databases_for_prediction_of_drug-target_interaction_A_survey_paper", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338675745_<b>Machine</b>_<b>learning</b>_approaches_and...", "snippet": "<b>Machine</b> <b>learning</b> methods used in DTI prediction can be categorized into six main branches.
