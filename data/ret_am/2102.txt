Hashing differs significantly from encryption, however, in that it is a one-way process. There is no easy way to unscramble the data, interpret the output, or reverse-engineer the input. There\u2019s no key, no system of two keys, no publicly-accessible keys, no certificates that will grant you access to the original data.
