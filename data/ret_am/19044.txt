Why might a cell make a lot of rRNA but only one copy of DNA? Cells might make lots of rRNA but only one copy of DNA because rRNA is a component of ribosomes, and many ribosomes are needed to keep up with the evil of protein synthesis needed by a cell. However, each cell needs only one set of DNA so it is ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-04-13T21:08:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.9", "name": "<b>Oracle Analysis of Sparse Automatic Music Transcription</b>", "url": "http://cmmr2012.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/sites/cmmr2012.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/files/pdf/papers/cmmr2012_submission_88.pdf", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "cmmr2012.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/sites/cmmr2012.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/files/pdf/papers/cmmr2012...", "snippet": "Music <b>transcription can be thought of as</b> an inherently sparse problem, as only a few notes are active at a given time. In this work non-negative sparse representations are required to decompose the magnitude spectogram.
