The potential difference between the two ends drives the water through the pipe like the current which is driven by the voltage difference across the resistive element. Moreover, the reduced resistance which increases the current is equivalent to a reduced cross section area of the pipe which reduces the water flow. With regard to a single equipment or a circuit of elements as a whole, Ohm\u2019s Law is used to calculate the total ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-30T19:52:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.1", "name": "<b>Frontiers</b> | Capturing the Current-Overpotential Nonlinearity of Lithium ...", "url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2019.00151/full", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.<b>frontiers</b>in.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2019.00151", "snippet": "In this paper, a Nonlinear Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (NLEIS) method is presented that allows capturing the nonlinearity of current and overpotential of a lithium-ion battery individually in charge and discharge direction. A DC bias is applied to the battery to shift its operating point to the nonlinear region of current and overpotential. An alternating current of a low amplitude (AC) is simultaneously superimposed in order to investigate the system additionally in the time domain.", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-31T18:23:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}]], "all_bing_queries": ["+(ohm's law)  is like +(analogy of water valve in house)", "+(ohm's law) is similar to +(analogy of water valve in house)", "+(ohm's law) can be thought of as +(analogy of water valve in house)", "+(ohm's law) can be compared to +(analogy of water valve in house)", "science +(ohm's law AND analogy)", "science +(\"ohm's law is like\")", "science +(\"ohm's law is similar\")", "science +(\"just as ohm's law\")", "science +(\"ohm's law can be thought of as\")", "science +(\"ohm's law can be compared to\")"]}
