Here, we train an ML model to recognize the sentiment based on the words and their order using a sentiment-labelled training set. This approach depends largely on the type of algorithm and the quality of the training data used. Let\u2019s look again at the stock trading example mentioned above. We take news headlines, and narrow them to lines which mention the particular company that we are interested in (often done by another NLP technique ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-02-02T15:28:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.9", "name": "<b>Recurrent Artificial Neural Networks</b> \u2013 Exploring AI", "url": "https://jacobmorrisweb.wordpress.com/2017/11/07/recurrent-artificial-neural-networks/", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://jacobmorrisweb.wordpress.com/2017/11/07/<b>recurrent-artificial-neural-networks</b>", "snippet": "Machines that learn <b>machine</b>-<b>learning</b> November 7, 2017; Categories.

This post will be a brief overview of a special type of artificial neural network (ANN): The recurrent artificial neural network (RNN). In computer science terms this is any ANN that contains a directed cycle. Basically, a RNN is any ANN with connections that form a loop in the ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-26T00:28:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], []], "all_bing_queries": ["+(lstm)  is like +(a machine learning algorithm)", "+(lstm) is similar to +(a machine learning algorithm)", "+(lstm) can be thought of as +(a machine learning algorithm)", "+(lstm) can be compared to +(a machine learning algorithm)", "machine learning +(lstm AND analogy)", "machine learning +(\"lstm is like\")", "machine learning +(\"lstm is similar\")", "machine learning +(\"just as lstm\")", "machine learning +(\"lstm can be thought of as\")", "machine learning +(\"lstm can be compared to\")"]}
