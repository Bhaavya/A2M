Finite automata are a ubiquitous formalism that is simple enough to model many real-life systems and phenomena, and they enjoy a large variety of theoretical properties: automata are closed under Boolean operations, have decidable emptiness and equivalence checking procedures, and can be ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-12-06T12:40:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.9", "name": "<b>Estimating matching affinity matrices under</b> low-rank constraints ...", "url": "https://academic.oup.com/imaiai/article/8/4/677/5552013", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://academic.oup.com/imaiai/article/8/4/677/5552013", "snippet": "1. Introduction. Optimal transport theory has attracted a lot of interests across a number of scientific disciplines, from pure mathematics (Villani, 2003) to various applications including <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b> (Benamou et al., 2015), mathematical statistics (del Barrio et al., 1999) and economics (Galichon, 2016).The basic problem of optimal transport is how to form pairs of agents drawn from two populations in order to maximize total matching affinities, also called total joint utility in ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-10-25T07:18:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], []], "all_bing_queries": ["+(lambda)  is like +(a type of function used in machine learning)", "+(lambda) is similar to +(a type of function used in machine learning)", "+(lambda) can be thought of as +(a type of function used in machine learning)", "+(lambda) can be compared to +(a type of function used in machine learning)", "machine learning +(lambda AND analogy)", "machine learning +(\"lambda is like\")", "machine learning +(\"lambda is similar\")", "machine learning +(\"just as lambda\")", "machine learning +(\"lambda can be thought of as\")", "machine learning +(\"lambda can be compared to\")"]}
