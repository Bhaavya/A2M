(by <b>analogy</b> with the work of Camarero et al. 2015). Conclusion. The piecewise model used to represent the size-density trajectories of pure even-aged stands of beech, oak, and Douglas-fir proved its ability to represent the size-density trajectories of a new species, ash, until stands get infected by the H. fraxineus. Thus, as for the other species studied, natural mortality ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-15T16:29:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.9", "name": "<b>Child Birth or Getting Kicked in the Balls</b> - <b>Science</b> Everyday", "url": "http://awesci.com/child-birth-or-getting-kicked-in-the-balls/", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "awesci.com/<b>child-birth-or-getting-kicked-in-the-balls</b>", "snippet": "By Anupum Pant.
