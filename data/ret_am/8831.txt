Lot of credit goes to David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel, two famous neurophysiologists, who showed how neurons in the visual cortex work. Their work determined how neurons with similar functions are organized into columns, tiny computational machines that relay information to a higher region of the brain, where visual image is progressively formed.
