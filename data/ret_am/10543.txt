Many real-life data sets, like those common to text mining and genomic studies are wide, meaning they contain a larger number of features (\\(p &gt; n\\)).As p increases, we\u2019re more likely to violate some of the OLS assumptions and alternative approaches should be considered. This was briefly illustrated in Chapter 4 where the presence of multicollinearity was diminishing the interpretability of our estimated coefficients due to inflated ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-02-02T07:03:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], [], [{"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.0", "name": "<b>Machine</b> <b>learning</b> methods (Chapter 7) - Mapping Species Distributions", "url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/mapping-species-distributions/machine-learning-methods/DCB5ADE9F03693BB806C751912693B11", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/mapping-species-distributions/<b>machine</b>-<b>learning</b>...", "snippet": "Statistical or <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b> approaches can be used to solve a supervised <b>learning</b> problem.
