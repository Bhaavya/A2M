The functions generate two keys: One is kept private, and one can be given out publicly. If someone wants to send you an encrypted file, she encrypts it with your public key. Once encrypted, you can only use the private key to decrypt the message.

With the public key, you can quickly verify the digital signature was created by the private key. Think of this as something of a jigsaw puzzle. The puzzle may be very difficult to complete, but when completed correctly you verify it at a glance. Feasting at the Hash House.
