Given a set of labeled training data, the algorithm generates the optimal hyperplane that divides the sample into their proper labels. Traditionally, SVMs are thought of as solving binary classification problems, however multiple hyperplanes can be used to divide the data into more than two label categories. The optimal hyperplane is defined as the hyperplane that creates the maximum margin ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-31T19:50:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.6", "name": "Metric AUC \u2014 sklearn", "url": "https://hittarpozor.com/classification-model-evaluation-metrics-in-scikit-learn-924/xmwe11748-6-", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://hittarpozor.com/classification-model-evaluation-<b>metrics</b>-in-scikit-learn-924/...", "snippet": "By <b>analogy</b>, the Higher the AUC, ...
