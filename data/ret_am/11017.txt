While <b>data augmentation can be thought of as</b> a synthetic data generation process, the synthesized samples are bound by the data at hand. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly popular to generate data in a purely synthetic fashion. The demands for large quantities of data are especially important in DL as compared to classical ML, meaning that data ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-11-24T03:54:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.2", "name": "(PDF) A Survey of Image Synthesis Methods for Visual <b>Machine</b> <b>Learning</b>", "url": "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344166151_A_Survey_of_Image_Synthesis_Methods_for_Visual_Machine_Learning", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344166151_A_Survey_of_Image_Synthesis_Methods...", "snippet": "Image synthesis designed for <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b> applications provides the means to efficiently generate large quantities of training data while controlling the generation process to provide the best ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-12-16T12:48:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.3", "name": "Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in Intrusion Detection Systems: A ...", "url": "https://www.scribd.com/document/429502817/Adversarial-Attacks-and-Defenses-in-Intrusion-Detection-Systems-A-Survey", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.scribd.com/document/429502817/Adversarial-Attacks-and-Defenses-in...", "snippet": "<b>Machine</b> <b>learning</b> is broadly speaking a two-step process (Figure 4).
