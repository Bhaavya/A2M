Dynamic programming. Dynamic programming refers to a set of algorithms with the ability to find optimal policies assuming a perfect model is available. DP algorithms are in general not widely used due to their very high computational cost for non-trivial problems. The two most popular methods in DP are policy iteration and value iteration. On a high level, policy iteration searches for the optimal policy by iterating through many policies, \u03c0\u03c0 ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-14T17:11:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.1", "name": "Accelerating Online Reinforcement <b>Learning</b> with <b>Offline</b> Datasets | DeepAI", "url": "https://deepai.org/publication/accelerating-online-reinforcement-learning-with-offline-datasets", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://deepai.org/publication/accelerating-online-reinforcement-<b>learning</b>-with-<b>offline</b>...", "snippet": "Accelerating Online Reinforcement <b>Learning</b> with <b>Offline</b> Datasets. 06/16/2020 \u2219 by Ashvin Nair, et al. \u2219 berkeley college \u2219 0 \u2219 share .
