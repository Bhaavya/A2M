Observation model and cyber attackThe measurements of the microgrid states are obtained by a set of sensors and can be modeled as (9.5) y (k) = C x (k) + v (k), where y (k) is the measurement, C is the <b>measurement matrix</b>, and v (k) is a zero-mean sensor measurement noise whose covariance matrix is R v. Generally, the objective of attackers is to insert false data into the observations as (9.6) y (k) = C x (k ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-20T03:38:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], [], [], []], "all_bing_queries": ["+(attack pattern)  is like +(thief breaking into your home)", "+(attack pattern) is similar to +(thief breaking into your home)", "+(attack pattern) can be thought of as +(thief breaking into your home)", "+(attack pattern) can be compared to +(thief breaking into your home)", "cybersecurity +(attack pattern AND analogy)", "cybersecurity +(\"attack pattern is like\")", "cybersecurity +(\"attack pattern is similar\")", "cybersecurity +(\"just as attack pattern\")", "cybersecurity +(\"attack pattern can be thought of as\")", "cybersecurity +(\"attack pattern can be compared to\")"]}
