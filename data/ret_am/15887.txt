For steel material, the traditional ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-20T12:37:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], [], [], []], "all_bing_queries": ["+(l2 loss)  is like +(forgetting words and grammar structures learned in a foreign language class)", "+(l2 loss) is similar to +(forgetting words and grammar structures learned in a foreign language class)", "+(l2 loss) can be thought of as +(forgetting words and grammar structures learned in a foreign language class)", "+(l2 loss) can be compared to +(forgetting words and grammar structures learned in a foreign language class)", "machine learning +(l2 loss AND analogy)", "machine learning +(\"l2 loss is like\")", "machine learning +(\"l2 loss is similar\")", "machine learning +(\"just as l2 loss\")", "machine learning +(\"l2 loss can be thought of as\")", "machine learning +(\"l2 loss can be compared to\")"]}
