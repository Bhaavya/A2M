Approaches to part assembly have typically used graphical models, of which Pictorial Structures [13,10,2] are an elegant method of relating body parts within a tree structure that supports direct in-ference of the marginals. Loopy belief propagation models [25,29,27] and fully connected models [28] require ap-proximations to infer the marginals. Model parameters can be trained iteratively [2], discriminatively [21 ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-08-07T21:27:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], [], [{"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.0", "name": "Fast adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope retinal montaging", "url": "https://opg.optica.org/boe/viewmedia.cfm?uri=boe-9-9-4317&html=true", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://opg.optica.org/boe/viewmedia.cfm?uri=boe-9-9-4317&amp;html=true", "snippet": "The field of view of high-resolution ophthalmoscopes that require the use of adaptive optics (AO) wavefront correction is limited by the isoplanatic patch of the eye, which varies across individual eyes and with the portion of the pupil used for illumination and/or imaging.
