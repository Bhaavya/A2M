Programmer is the engineer to build this robot. But if you just simply want to this robot, you just need to know what operation you can use with this. For example there is a stack in ADT. Just think of one robot called \u201cstack\u201d and what it does is stores all the things that you put in it and take it back to you the item but in reverse order that you put in. So the item that you put in at the last ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-26T01:55:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], [], [], [{"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.0", "name": "Predicting <b>cell phone adoption metrics</b> using <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b> and ...", "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585321000617", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585321000617", "snippet": "In this paper we present a <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b> method that uses publicly available satellite imagery to predict telecoms demand metrics, including cell phone adoption and spending on mobile services, and apply the method to Malawi and Ethiopia.
