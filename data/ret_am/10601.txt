It could also be used to predict ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-11-12T00:51:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], [], []], "all_bing_queries": ["+(rotational invariance)  is like +(machine that can turn any object into a perfect circle)", "+(rotational invariance) is similar to +(machine that can turn any object into a perfect circle)", "+(rotational invariance) can be thought of as +(machine that can turn any object into a perfect circle)", "+(rotational invariance) can be compared to +(machine that can turn any object into a perfect circle)", "machine learning +(rotational invariance AND analogy)", "machine learning +(\"rotational invariance is like\")", "machine learning +(\"rotational invariance is similar\")", "machine learning +(\"just as rotational invariance\")", "machine learning +(\"rotational invariance can be thought of as\")", "machine learning +(\"rotational invariance can be compared to\")"]}
