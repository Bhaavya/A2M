The decoder is another RNN, which takes in the final hidden state vector of the encoder and uses it to predict the words of the output reply. Let&#39;s look at the first cell. The cell&#39;s job is to take in the vector ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-30T02:41:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], []], "all_bing_queries": ["+(rnn)  is like +(a teacher)", "+(rnn) is similar to +(a teacher)", "+(rnn) can be thought of as +(a teacher)", "+(rnn) can be compared to +(a teacher)", "machine learning +(rnn AND analogy)", "machine learning +(\"rnn is like\")", "machine learning +(\"rnn is similar\")", "machine learning +(\"just as rnn\")", "machine learning +(\"rnn can be thought of as\")", "machine learning +(\"rnn can be compared to\")"]}
