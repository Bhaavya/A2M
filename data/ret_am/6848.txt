A line of work has shown that predictors learned by deep neural networks are not robust to adversarial examples (Szegedy et al.,2014;Biggio et al.,2013;Goodfellow et al.,2015). This has led to a long line of research studying different aspects of robustness to adversarial examples. In this paper, we consider the problem of distribution-independent <b>learning</b> of halfspaces that are robust to ad-versarial examples at test time, also referred to as ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-11-21T12:03:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], [], []], "all_bing_queries": ["+(empirical risk minimization (erm))  is like +(finding the best possible fit for a curve to a set of data points)", "+(empirical risk minimization (erm)) is similar to +(finding the best possible fit for a curve to a set of data points)", "+(empirical risk minimization (erm)) can be thought of as +(finding the best possible fit for a curve to a set of data points)", "+(empirical risk minimization (erm)) can be compared to +(finding the best possible fit for a curve to a set of data points)", "machine learning +(empirical risk minimization (erm) AND analogy)", "machine learning +(\"empirical risk minimization (erm) is like\")", "machine learning +(\"empirical risk minimization (erm) is similar\")", "machine learning +(\"just as empirical risk minimization (erm)\")", "machine learning +(\"empirical risk minimization (erm) can be thought of as\")", "machine learning +(\"empirical risk minimization (erm) can be compared to\")"]}
