For downsampling, although the signal recovered from the <b>downsampling is similar</b> to the original signal in the overall trend, the image reconstruction effect is not good because the key information of the image is not collected. The signal restoration effect becomes worse and the program operation efficiency becomes lower when the sampling multiple is increased. Fig. 9 shows the signal recovered after random sampling.
