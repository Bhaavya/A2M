Such tasks involve recognition, diagnosis, planning, robot control, prediction, etc. The \\changes&quot; might be either enhancements to already performing systems or ab initio synthesis of new systems. To be slightly more speci c, we show the architecture of a typical AI \\agent&quot; in Fig. 1.1. This agent perceives and models its environment and computes appropriate actions ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-12-02T06:08:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.7", "name": "Nils J.
