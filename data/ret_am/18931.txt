There are many proteins involved in DNA replication and all of the functions are extremely important. These include DNA polymerases, single-strand DNA binding proteins, primers, helicases, and ligase. DNA polymerases attach to the primers and duplicate DNA. Single-strand DNA binding proteins function as a structure for the DNA. Helicase is essential during DNA replication because they separate double-stranded DNA into single strands ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-12T21:31:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.7", "name": "<b>DNA Vocabulary Page 2</b> - <b>Science</b> @ Colegio Montessori", "url": "https://sites.google.com/a/montessori.edu.co/science/area-content/dna-vocabulary-1/dna-vocabulary-2", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://<b>sites.google.com</b>/a/montessori.edu.co/<b>science</b>/area-content/dna-vocabulary-1/dna...", "snippet": "Montessori <b>Science</b> Challenge 2012.
