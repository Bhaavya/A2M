Abstract: A cyberphysical system (CPS) in biology requires sensor input that represents, as closely as possible, cell activity. Much work is expended on the development of wearable sensors that detect the expression of cell activity filtered through many processes. Recent work discloses that gene <b>transcription can be thought of as</b> a signal, with ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-15T07:25:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.8", "name": "<b>Oracle Analysis of Sparse Automatic Music Transcription</b>", "url": "http://cmmr2012.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/sites/cmmr2012.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/files/pdf/papers/cmmr2012_submission_88.pdf", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "cmmr2012.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/sites/cmmr2012.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/files/pdf/papers/cmmr2012...", "snippet": "Music <b>transcription can be thought of as</b> an inherently sparse problem, as only a few notes are active at a given time.
