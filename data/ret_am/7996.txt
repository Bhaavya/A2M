In the image below, the linear model is not as accurate as the polynomial. Specifically, the linear model makes two misclassifications. But, the linear model is simpler and may generalize better to other datasets better than the polynomial model, which is more complex and accurate but may be overfit to this particular dataset. Regularization is a way to take the complexity of the model into account when ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-02-01T08:46:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.4", "name": "A comparative study of <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b> methods for predicting the ...", "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027022000024", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027022000024", "snippet": "The tailored <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b> pipelines are composed of different blocks such as data processing and dimensionality reduction.
