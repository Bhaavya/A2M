The intuition behind this mathematical model is that similar data points will be closer together. k-means then tries to determine different k ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-02-02T11:50:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.4", "name": "Discover 2 unsupervised techniques that help categorize data", "url": "https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/post/Discover-2-unsupervised-techniques-that-help-categorize-data", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/post/Discover-2-unsupervised-techniques...", "snippet": "<b>K-means is similar</b> to K-nearest neighbors, in that it generally uses the same Euclidian distance calculation for determining closeness between the centroid and the items (represented as points) that requires the user to specify the K value (Figure 2). Operating in an iterative fashion, K-means begins with less homogeneous groups of instances and modifies each group during each iteration to attain increased homogeneity within the group.
