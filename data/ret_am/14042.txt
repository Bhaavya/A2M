Data, in our HTM world, has a spatial aspect. This might not be change along a spatial dimension; space has a more general sense. For instance, the space might be a range of voltages, or sets of voltages from an EKG, for instance. Spatial data usually varies so complexly that we ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-12-11T03:28:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.8", "name": "Convolutional Networks | SeminarDeepLearning", "url": "https://mlai-bonn.github.io/SeminarDeepLearning/s05_ConvolutionalNetworks.html", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://mlai-bonn.github.io/SeminarDeep<b>Learning</b>/s05_ConvolutionalNetworks.html", "snippet": "In <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b> problems we often introduce prior assumptions (or preferences) about the model, e.g. in the form of a probability distribution on its parameters. The strength of the prior depends on how concentrated its probability distribution is, which can for example be reflected in the weight of a regularization term added to the loss. A Gaussian distribution with small variance is a classic example of a strong prior. When talking about an infinitely strong prior, we refer to the ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-12-29T03:12:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.9", "name": "<b>Training Autoencoders on ImageNet Using Torch</b> 7 \u00b7 Siavash Khallaghi", "url": "http://siavashk.github.io/2016/02/22/autoencoder-imagenet/", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "siavashk.github.io/2016/02/22/autoencoder-imagenet", "snippet": "It might be easy for seasoned <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b> scientists to extend the architecture from grayscale to color images, but for me it was non-trivial.
