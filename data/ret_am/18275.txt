The only information that was important was the size of the orbit, which was described by \u201cn\u201d the principle quantum number.", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-02-02T13:05:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.3", "name": "<b>Valence_Electrons_Hw - Sodium Draw the Bohr Model Electron</b> ...", "url": "https://www.coursehero.com/file/76910612/Valence-Electrons-Hw/", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.coursehero.com/file/76910612/Valence-Electrons-Hw", "snippet": "2.
