In a network, nodes are used to connect two or more networks.", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-02-02T19:05:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.8", "name": "Microwaves Part VI - Test Equipment &amp; Frequency Conversion, October ...", "url": "http://www.rfcafe.com/references/radio-electronics/microwaves-part-vi-radio-electronics-october-1949.htm", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "www.rfcafe.com/references/radio-electronics/microwaves-part-vi-radio-electronics...", "snippet": "The third type or transition wavemeter may <b>be thought</b> of as half co-axial <b>line</b> and half cylindrical cavity - hence its name.
