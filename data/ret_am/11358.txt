Advantages of Tanh Activation Function. The Tanh activation function is both non-linear and differentiable which are good characteristics for activation function. Since its output ranges from +1 to -1, it can be used to transform the output of a neuron to a negative sign. Disadvantages. Since its functioning is similar to a sigmoid function, it also suffers from the issue of Vanishing gradient if ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-02-02T07:30:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.1", "name": "Activation functions in Neural Networks - <b>GeeksforGeeks</b>", "url": "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/activation-functions-neural-networks/", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.<b>geeksforgeeks</b>.org/activation-functions-neural-networks", "snippet": "Get hold of all the important <b>Machine</b> <b>Learning</b> Concepts with the <b>Machine</b> <b>Learning</b> Foundation Course at a student-friendly price and become industry ready.
