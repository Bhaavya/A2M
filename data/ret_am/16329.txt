By this logic, the final hidden state vector of the encoder <b>RNN can be thought of as</b> a pretty accurate representation of the whole input text. The decoder is another RNN, which takes in the final hidden state vector of the encoder and uses it to predict the words of the output reply. Let&#39;s look at the first cell. The cell&#39;s job is to take in the vector ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-30T02:41:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], []], "all_bing_queries": ["+(rnn)  is like +(a black box that takes in data as input, and produces predictions or classifications as output)", "+(rnn) is similar to +(a black box that takes in data as input, and produces predictions or classifications as output)", "+(rnn) can be thought of as +(a black box that takes in data as input, and produces predictions or classifications as output)", "+(rnn) can be compared to +(a black box that takes in data as input, and produces predictions or classifications as output)", "machine learning +(rnn AND analogy)", "machine learning +(\"rnn is like\")", "machine learning +(\"rnn is similar\")", "machine learning +(\"just as rnn\")", "machine learning +(\"rnn can be thought of as\")", "machine learning +(\"rnn can be compared to\")"]}
