In its basic configuration, the program generates compositions then improves them based on evaluative feedback from a human listener. The listener serves as a &quot;tutor&quot; for the program by judging the quality of each composition. For purposes of this study, the program was given the capability of monitoring the listener&#39;s EEG responses to each musical passage ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-23T11:27:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], [], []], "all_bing_queries": ["+(bidirectional)  is like +(two-way conversation)", "+(bidirectional) is similar to +(two-way conversation)", "+(bidirectional) can be thought of as +(two-way conversation)", "+(bidirectional) can be compared to +(two-way conversation)", "machine learning +(bidirectional AND analogy)", "machine learning +(\"bidirectional is like\")", "machine learning +(\"bidirectional is similar\")", "machine learning +(\"just as bidirectional\")", "machine learning +(\"bidirectional can be thought of as\")", "machine learning +(\"bidirectional can be compared to\")"]}
