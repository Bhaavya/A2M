The current cost of the solution is very high, since four tracking interferometers are needed at the ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-31T23:59:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.3", "name": "<b>Machine</b> <b>Learning</b> for Precision Health Economics and Outcomes Research ...", "url": "https://jheor.org/article/12698-machine-learning-for-precision-health-economics-and-outcomes-research-p-heor-conceptual-review-of-applications-and-next-steps", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://jheor.org/article/12698-<b>machine</b>-<b>learning</b>-for-precision-health-economics-and...", "snippet": "Through a conceptualized example, the objective of this review is to highlight the capabilities and limitations of <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b> (ML) applications to P-HEOR and to contextualize the potential opportunities and challenges for the wide adoption of ML for health economics.
