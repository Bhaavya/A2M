We propose a methodology based on archetypoid analysis (ADA) that overcomes the weaknesses of previous methodologies used to establish typologies. ADA is an objective, data-driven methodology that seeks extreme patterns, the archetypal profiles in the data. ADA also explains the data as percentages of the archetypal patterns, which makes this technique understandable and accessible even for ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2020-02-03T13:13:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.3", "name": "<b>Weihua Dong&#39;s research</b> works | <b>Beijing Normal University</b>, Beijing (bnu ...", "url": "https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Weihua-Dong-2035376395", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Weihua-Dong-2035376395", "snippet": "Weihua Dong&#39;s 43 research works with 630 citations and 12,819 reads, including: Indoor Wayfinding in Real-world Environments and Virtual Reality: A Comparison", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-12-14T20:51:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], [{"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.0", "name": "The grid code for ordered experience | Nature Reviews Neuroscience", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-021-00499-9", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-021-00499-9", "snippet": "<b>Just as landmarks</b> have ...
