In supervised <b>learning</b>, we saw algorithms that tried to make their outputs mimic the labels y given in the training set. In that setting, the labels gave an unambiguous \u201cright answer\u201d for each of the inputs x. In contrast, for many sequential decision making and control problems, it is very difficult to provide this type of explicit supervision ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-15T20:40:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.4", "name": "(PDF) <b>INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING AN EARLY DRAFT</b> OF A PROPOSED ...", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39768152/INTRODUCTION_TO_MACHINE_LEARNING_AN_EARLY_DRAFT_OF_A_PROPOSED_TEXTBOOK", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.academia.edu/39768152/<b>INTRODUCTION_TO_MACHINE_LEARNING_AN_EARLY_DRAFT</b>_OF_A...", "snippet": "<b>INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING AN EARLY DRAFT</b> OF A PROPOSED TEXTBOOK.
