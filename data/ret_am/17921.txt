Our physics misconceptions frequently remain unexamined, and often persist well into adulthood <b>science</b> and engineering careers. For example, RP Feynman mentions the Poynting-flow concept in &quot;The Feynman Lectures,&quot; Chapter 27, and performs EM-field <b>energy flow</b> analysis on capacitors and resistors. But then he doesn&#39;t analyze 2-wire transmission lines, nor does he link all the components together into a continuous system ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-28T16:24:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.7", "name": "Wallach-<b>Kogan Creativity</b> Tests \u2013 John Dabell", "url": "https://johndabell.com/2020/01/08/wallace-kogan-tests/", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://johndabell.com/2020/01/08/wallace-kogan-tests", "snippet": "In their book Active Assessment: Thinking, Learning and Assessment in <b>Science</b>, Stuart Naylor and Brenda Keogh provide a couple of interesting examples well worth asking children to do: \u2018a whale is like a submarine because\u2019\u2026.. and \u2018an <b>electric circuit is like</b> a central heating system because\u2026\u2019", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-31T19:25:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.8", "name": "<b>Chapter 13 - Electric Circuits</b> Flashcards | <b>Quizlet</b>", "url": "https://quizlet.com/332820322/chapter-13-electric-circuits-flash-cards/", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://<b>quizlet.com</b>/332820322/<b>chapter-13-electric-circuits</b>-flash-cards", "snippet": "<b>Science</b>; Engineering; Electrical Engineering; <b>Chapter 13 - Electric Circuits</b>.
