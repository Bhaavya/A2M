For example, redundant services and components should be in place for any part of your network that should not be down for more than an hour. No matter how small you company is, your network should include two identical servers: one online, and the other with a fail-safe switch so that if the first goes down it automatically comes online. Another aspect of redundancy is making sure that you data and systems are backed up ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-12-30T09:44:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.1", "name": "U.K. Law for the U.S. Employer, Part II: Discrimination, Data Privacy ...", "url": "https://ogletree.com/insights/u-k-law-for-the-u-s-employer-part-ii-discrimination-data-privacy-and-termination-rights/", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://ogletree.com/insights/u-k-law-for-the-u-s-employer-part-ii-discrimination-data...", "snippet": "<b>Redundancy is similar</b> to the U.S. term, \u201creduction in force,\u201d and broadly occurs when a change in circumstances dictates that fewer employees are required to perform particular duties or to perform those duties in a particular place.
