Just like a function key is used to implement a computer task, a surgical tool is used to perform a surgical step. The manipulated tissue reacts: tumours bleed, vessels contract. These tissue actions, in turn, evoke surgeon reactions. Every surgeon responds uniquely to a given surgical event. Each action-reaction sequence can be labelled a state of the surgical field.
