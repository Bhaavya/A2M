Just like flashcards, data are provided with labels to a supervised <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b> app, which then allows the pattern recognition algorithm to predict the label and train itself over time. Once the supervised ML app is fully-trained, it then becomes capable of identifying new &amp; never-seen-before examples. Here\u2019s an example that illustrates this perfectly .
