CHAPTER 1. PARTICLE KINEMATICS. 1.2. Single Particle Kinematics . We start with the simplest kind of system, a single unconstrained particle, free to move in three dimensional space, under the inuence of a force F . 1.2.1. Motion in conguration space. The motion of the particle is described by a function which gives its position as a function of time. These positions are points in Euclidean space.
