As mentioned above, the internal motion (molecular vibration) and the rotation of the target molecule can influence the collision process [11 ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-11-01T08:21:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], [], [], []], "all_bing_queries": ["+(attack mode)  is like +(wolf going after its prey)", "+(attack mode) is similar to +(wolf going after its prey)", "+(attack mode) can be thought of as +(wolf going after its prey)", "+(attack mode) can be compared to +(wolf going after its prey)", "cybersecurity +(attack mode AND analogy)", "cybersecurity +(\"attack mode is like\")", "cybersecurity +(\"attack mode is similar\")", "cybersecurity +(\"just as attack mode\")", "cybersecurity +(\"attack mode can be thought of as\")", "cybersecurity +(\"attack mode can be compared to\")"]}
