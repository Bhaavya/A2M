The main idea behind a SVM is that it&#39;s trying to find a hyperplane separating those points in space, with the positive examples on one side, and the negative examples on the other. This is where the idea of &quot;<b>machine</b>&quot; comes into the name. Imagine attaching a spring to each of the points that&#39;s the closest to the separating hyperplane, and the other end of the spring to the hyperplane.
