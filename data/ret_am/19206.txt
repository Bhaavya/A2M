Motor proteins transport ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-02-02T09:07:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], [{"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.0", "name": "vetmed.tamu.edu", "url": "https://vetmed.tamu.edu/peer/wp-content/uploads/sites/72/2021/06/cell-biology-teacher-guide.docx", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://vetmed.tamu.edu/peer/wp-content/uploads/sites/72/2021/06/cell-biology-teacher...", "snippet": "The Golgi apparatus ensures products are delivered to where they are needed. The <b>Golgi can be compared to</b> a post office sending out the packaged final products. Mitochondria. Mitochondria are membrane-bound organelles. Their job is to convert the chemical energy in food (most often glucose) into ATP (adenosine triphosphate) which is the energy currency of the cells. In the cell city metaphor, mitochondria are the power plants. Lysosomes. Lysosomes are small circular membrane-bound organelles ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-10-18T22:30:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}]], "all_bing_queries": ["+(golgi)  is like +(postal service)", "+(golgi) is similar to +(postal service)", "+(golgi) can be thought of as +(postal service)", "+(golgi) can be compared to +(postal service)", "science +(golgi AND analogy)", "science +(\"golgi is like\")", "science +(\"golgi is similar\")", "science +(\"just as golgi\")", "science +(\"golgi can be thought of as\")", "science +(\"golgi can be compared to\")"]}
