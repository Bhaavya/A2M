The model will have a low accuracy if it is overfitting. This happens because your model is trying too hard to capture the noise in your training dataset. By noise we mean the data points that don\u2019t really represent the true properties of your data, but random chance. <b>Learning</b> such data points, makes your model more flexible, at the risk of overfitting.
