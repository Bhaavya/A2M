What Is a <b>Good Analogy</b> for the Ribosome? By Staff Writer Last Updated March 24, 2020. Follow Us: Facebook . Twitter . Ribosomes are like chefs; they take the ingredients and put them together in a complex finished product. Ribosomes are organelles within cells responsible for taking the mRNA and constructing complex polypeptides. A ribosome is a cell organelle that functions as a micro-machine for making proteins. Their process relies on specialized tRNA for translating the mRNA ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-30T07:08:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.6", "name": "What is the ribosome in a cell City?", "url": "https://treehozz.com/what-is-the-ribosome-in-a-cell-city", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://treehozz.com/what-is-the-ribosome-in-a-cell-city", "snippet": "Category: <b>science</b> genetics. 4.9/5 (214 Views . 24 Votes) Ribosomes build proteins. They are the protein buliders or protein synthesizers of the cell. They are like construction guys who connect one amino acid at a time and build long chains. They are found in the Rough ER and in the cytosol. Further detail about this can be seen here. Consequently, what is a ribosome <b>in a city</b>?
