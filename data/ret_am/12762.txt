The current cost of the solution is very high, since four tracking interferometers are needed at the ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-31T23:59:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.4", "name": "(PDF) A <b>Machine</b> <b>Learning</b> fMRI Approach in the Diagnosis of Autism", "url": "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350198893_A_Machine_Learning_fMRI_Approach_in_the_Diagnosis_of_Autism", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350198893_A_<b>Machine</b>_<b>Learning</b>_fMRI_Approach_in...", "snippet": "As such, <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b> methods have been consistently applied to facilitate diagnosis, although the scarcity of potent autism-related biomarkers is a bottleneck.
