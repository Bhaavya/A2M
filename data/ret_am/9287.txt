Deep <b>Learning</b> is suitable for problems that are hard to directly tackle using naive algorithms due to the large number of dimensions involved. A good example is the problem of identifying objects in images. Symbolic regression on the other hand is a very powerful method for discovering simple and explicit relationships between variables.", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-31T04:13:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], []], "all_bing_queries": ["+(regression)  is like +(carpenter using a level)", "+(regression) is similar to +(carpenter using a level)", "+(regression) can be thought of as +(carpenter using a level)", "+(regression) can be compared to +(carpenter using a level)", "machine learning +(regression AND analogy)", "machine learning +(\"regression is like\")", "machine learning +(\"regression is similar\")", "machine learning +(\"just as regression\")", "machine learning +(\"regression can be thought of as\")", "machine learning +(\"regression can be compared to\")"]}
