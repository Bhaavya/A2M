A/B tests are very effective at showing which of a small handful of options performs the best, as Ron Kohavi and Stefan Thomke point out in their 2017 article in Harvard Business Review. For brands that want to test only two or three variations of one element, an A/B test can produce a usable result with a modest sample size. That ease has made A/B testing very popular. Yet A/B tests are also quite ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-23T14:17:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.1", "name": "Multi-Armed Bandits - The Data Incubator", "url": "https://www.thedataincubator.com/blog/2016/07/25/multi-armed-bandits-2/", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.thedataincubator.com/blog/2016/07/25/multi-armed-bandits-2", "snippet": "Traditional <b>A-B testing can be thought of as</b> a special case of the multi-armed bandit problem, in which we choose to pursue a strategy of pure exploration in the initial testing phase, followed by a period of pure exploitation in which we choose the most valuable \u201carm\u201d 100% of the time.
