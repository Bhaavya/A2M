Classes. Objects are defined by classes by simply specifying the instance variables and associated methods that will reside within a particular object. A class is itself an object. It does not contain any data but it defines a &quot;model&quot; for other objects. An AS/400 file object can be viewed within the generic OOP object model diagram, as shown in 2.
