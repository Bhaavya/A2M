Deep <b>Learning</b> is suitable for problems that are hard to directly tackle using naive algorithms due to the large number of dimensions involved. A good example is the problem of identifying objects in images. Symbolic regression on the other hand is a very powerful method for discovering simple and explicit relationships between variables.", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-31T04:13:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.8", "name": "Midterm Solutions - Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science", "url": "https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/10601_fall2012/exams/midterm_solutions.pdf", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/10601_fall2012/exams/midterm_solutions.pdf", "snippet": "Created Date: 10/22/2012 9:45:41 AM", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-02-01T03:34:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.9", "name": "[<b>Discussion] Potentially a dumb question</b>, but what is the difference ...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/860wke/discussion_potentially_a_dumb_question_but_what/", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://<b>www.reddit.com</b>/r/<b>MachineLearning</b>/comments/860wke/discussion_potentially_a_dumb...", "snippet": "Supervised <b>learning</b> (especially continuous <b>regression) can be thought of as</b> a type of extra/interpolation (or &quot;curve fitting&quot;), but with a specific goal in mind, namely performance on an unknown test set, separate from the training set.
