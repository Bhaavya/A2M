Introduction. The best way to understand something is to try and explain it. And if you keep getting better every time you try to explain it, well, that\u2019s roughly the gist of what Reinforcement <b>Learning</b> (RL) is about. Given how different RL is from Supervised or Unsupervised <b>Learning</b>, I figured that the best strategy is to go slow, and to go slow is to start with the <b>Markov</b> assumption, introduce the concept of a scalar reward and build into <b>Markov</b> Reward Processes (MRPs).Then, once our ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-02-01T06:47:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.8", "name": "<b>Markov property of Markov chains and</b> its test | Request PDF", "url": "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221544204_Markov_property_of_Markov_chains_and_its_test", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221544204_<b>Markov_property_of_Markov_chains</b>...", "snippet": "<b>Markov</b> chains, with <b>Markov</b> <b>property</b> as its essence, are widely used in the fields such as information theory, automatic control, communication techniques, genetics, computer sciences, economic ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-12-25T07:31:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.9", "name": "<b>What are the assumptions made by hidden Markov</b> models? - Quora", "url": "https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-assumptions-made-by-hidden-Markov-models", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.quora.com/<b>What-are-the-assumptions-made-by-hidden-Markov</b>-models", "snippet": "Answer: <b>Assumptions made by hidden Markov</b> Models Hidden <b>Markov</b> Models Fundamentals Abstract How <b>can</b> we apply <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b> to data that is represented as a sequence of observations over time?
