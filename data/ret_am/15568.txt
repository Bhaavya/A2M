This method is also efficient since it requires less amount of training data, which is not always available. Due to this fact, early stopping requires lesser time for training compared to other regularization methods. Repeating the early stopping process many times may result in the model overfitting the validation dataset, just as similar as overfitting occurs in the case of training ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-29T02:49:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.1", "name": "Lecture 3: Regularization For Deep Models", "url": "http://wavelab.uwaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Lecture_3.pdf", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "wavelab.uwaterloo.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Lecture_3.pdf", "snippet": "Furthermore, when comparing two <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b> algorithms train both with either augmented or non-augmented dataset.
