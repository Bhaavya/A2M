Tumor Suppressor Genes: Retinoblastoma - The RB Gene. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss, and a change in bowel movements. These types of <b>tumor suppressor genes can be thought of as</b> &quot;gatekeeper&quot; genes. Cervical cancer represents the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide, and in the U.S., HPV is detected in 90% of cervical cancer tumors.

Activated KIT (or, in a few cases, a closely-related protein called PDGFR-alpha) is the primary cellular event that causes most GISTs.1 Other oncogenes involved in some GISTs are BRAF (rare) and KRAS, HRAS, and NTRK fusions (very rare).", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-18T23:47:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}]], "all_bing_queries": ["+(tumor suppressor genes)  is like +(policemen in the city)", "+(tumor suppressor genes) is similar to +(policemen in the city)", "+(tumor suppressor genes) can be thought of as +(policemen in the city)", "+(tumor suppressor genes) can be compared to +(policemen in the city)", "science +(tumor suppressor genes AND analogy)", "science +(\"tumor suppressor genes is like\")", "science +(\"tumor suppressor genes is similar\")", "science +(\"just as tumor suppressor genes\")", "science +(\"tumor suppressor genes can be thought of as\")", "science +(\"tumor suppressor genes can be compared to\")"]}
