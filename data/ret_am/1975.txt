Alice wants to get a message from Bob so creates a lock-box and a key to unlock it. Alice sends the (open!) box to Bob who puts in his message and closes the auto-locking door. Once shut, only Alice can open it with her (secret) key. Bob has to make sure it\u2019s Alice\u2019s box before sending off his locked message so he relies on some trusted third party to verify the identity of the box (X.506 PKI and trusted root ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-07-13T06:15:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], [], [{"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.0", "name": "<b>Encryption, decryption</b>, and cracking (article) | <b>Khan Academy</b>", "url": "https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computers-and-internet/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:online-data-security/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:data-encryption-techniques/a/encryption-decryption-and-code-cracking", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://<b>www.khanacademy.org</b>/computing/computers-and-internet/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:online...", "snippet": "Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift).
