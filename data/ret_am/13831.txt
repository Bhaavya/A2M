Here, we train an ML model to recognize the sentiment based on the words and their order using a sentiment-labelled training set. This approach depends largely on the type of algorithm and the quality of the training data used. Let\u2019s look again at the stock trading example mentioned above. We take news headlines, and narrow them to lines which mention the particular company that we are interested in (often done by another NLP technique ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-02-02T15:28:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.8", "name": "Bayesian_uncertainty_LSTM/README.md at master \u00b7 tankwin08/Bayesian ...", "url": "https://github.com/tankwin08/Bayesian_uncertainty_LSTM/blob/master/README.md", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://<b>github.com</b>/tankwin08/Bayesian_uncertainty_LSTM/blob/master/README.md", "snippet": "Results.
