Like the waste disposal and recycling company the lysosome helps to break down any unwanted macromolecules in the cell. The centriole is a cylindrical organelle located near the nucleus. They help in the division of the cell and the organization of the chromosomes. The microtubules also play a role in cell division and serves as a temporary support for other organelles.
