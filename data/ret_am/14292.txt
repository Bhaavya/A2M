Actually, we don&#39;t want this. The probability of any class should never be exactly zero as this might cause problems later. It might get very very small, but should never be 0. \u21a9. Backpropagation is only a clever implementation of gradient descent. It belongs to the bigger class of iterative descent algorithms. \u21a9.
