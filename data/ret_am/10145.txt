The algorithms tested in this study include linear regression, elastic ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-06T07:09:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], [], [], []], "all_bing_queries": ["+(l2 regularization)  is like +(tuning a musician's instrument)", "+(l2 regularization) is similar to +(tuning a musician's instrument)", "+(l2 regularization) can be thought of as +(tuning a musician's instrument)", "+(l2 regularization) can be compared to +(tuning a musician's instrument)", "machine learning +(l2 regularization AND analogy)", "machine learning +(\"l2 regularization is like\")", "machine learning +(\"l2 regularization is similar\")", "machine learning +(\"just as l2 regularization\")", "machine learning +(\"l2 regularization can be thought of as\")", "machine learning +(\"l2 regularization can be compared to\")"]}
