Therefore, physical and mechanical properties should be measured on thermally equilibrated samples, only, to be reliable. And, if possible, as a function of temperature within the stability region of the HEA. In contrast to the predictions of the existence of thousands or even millions of HEAs (see, e.g., Widom [13,33], Senkov et al. ), only a very limited number (\u224880) of intermetallic systems has been identified ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-11T04:32:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.1", "name": "Viruses | Free Full-Text | <b>Spatiotemporal Analysis of COVID-19</b> ...", "url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/13/3/463/htm", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/13/3/463/htm", "snippet": "(1) Background: A better understanding of COVID-19 dynamics in terms of interactions among individuals would be of paramount importance to increase the effectiveness of containment measures.
