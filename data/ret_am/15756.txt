Unfortunately, in comparisong to gradient descent, stochastic gradient is quite sensitive to the selection of a good <b>learning</b> rate. There is one more practical issues related to the use of SGD as a <b>learning</b> algorithm: do you really select a random point (or subset of random points) at each step, or do you stream through the data in order.
