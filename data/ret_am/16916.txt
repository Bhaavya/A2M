Ribosomes are like chefs; they take the ingredients and put them together in a complex finished product. Ribosomes are organelles within cells responsible for taking the mRNA and constructing complex polypeptides. A ribosome is a cell organelle that functions as a micro-machine for making proteins.

They are the protein buliders or protein synthesizers of the cell. They are like construction guys who connect one amino acid at a time and build long chains.
