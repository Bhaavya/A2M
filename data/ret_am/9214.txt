Each point is assigned to a one and only one cluster (hard ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-02T18:49:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.9", "name": "Ologs: A Categorical Framework <b>for Knowledge Representation</b>", "url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024274", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024274", "snippet": "For example, one could record every known prime as instances of a type and a <b>machine</b> could automatically check that Goldbach\u2019s conjecture (written as an olog containing as a type) holds for all example \u201cso far.\u201d With definitions, theorems, and examples all written in the same computer-readable language of ologs, one may hope for much more advanced searching and knowledge retrieval by humans.
