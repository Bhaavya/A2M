For some authors it is related to the brain or a fundamental way of thinking about AI, but we can simply think of it as a sensible idea of applying a set of simple transformations to an image to built a complex transformation. The challenge of <b>machine</b> <b>learning</b> is how to determine what these transformations should be. Each of the simpler deterministic transformations can actually have very many parameters. In the case of DeepFace there are ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-15T03:41:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], [{"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.0", "name": "Wide and deep <b>learning</b> for <b>peer-to-peer lending</b> - ScienceDirect", "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741741930377X", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741741930377X", "snippet": "After training the model, it is crucial to evaluate the performance of the model on the test samples and compare its performance with the benchmarks, namely, deep <b>learning</b> (DP), wide <b>learning</b> (WL), random forest (RF), gradient boosting regression algorithm (GB), and support vector <b>machine</b> (SVM). 15 Precision and recall are used as performance metrics of the models.
