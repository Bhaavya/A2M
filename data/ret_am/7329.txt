In particular, tuning the <b>learning</b> rates in the stochastic optimization process is still one of the main bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose a new stochastic gradient descent procedure for deep networks that does not require any <b>learning</b> rate setting. Contrary to previous methods, we do not ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-10-02T09:13:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], [], [{"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.0", "name": "HW02.pdf - CSC413\\/2516 Winter 2020 with Professor Jimmy Ba Homework 2 ...", "url": "https://www.coursehero.com/file/55290018/HW02pdf/", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.coursehero.com/file/55290018/HW02pdf", "snippet": "View HW02.pdf from CSC 413 at University of Toronto.
