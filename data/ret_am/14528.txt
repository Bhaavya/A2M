In this algorithm, the probabilities describing the possible outcomes of a single trial are modelled using a logistic function. Advantages: Logistic regression is designed for this purpose (classification), and is most useful for understanding the influence of several independent variables on a single outcome variable. Disadvantages: Works only when the predicted variable is binary, assumes all predictors are ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-02-03T02:58:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.2", "name": "D e e p <b>L e ar n i n g</b> Y ou T u b e V i d e o T ags", "url": "http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/pdfs/28.pdf", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/pdfs/28.pdf", "snippet": "<b>classification can be compared to</b> image labelling and ge.html image captioning, both of which have been heavily studied in recent years.
