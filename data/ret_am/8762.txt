Inductance is the tendency of an electrical conductor to oppose a change in the electric current flowing through it. L is used to represent the inductance, and Henry is the SI unit of inductance. 1 Henry is defined as the amount of inductance required to produce an emf of 1 volt in a conductor when the current change in the conductor is at the rate of 1 Ampere per second.. An electric current flowing through a conductor creates a magnetic field around it.", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-02-02T11:13:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}]], "all_bing_queries": ["+(induction)  is like +(human brain)", "+(induction) is similar to +(human brain)", "+(induction) can be thought of as +(human brain)", "+(induction) can be compared to +(human brain)", "machine learning +(induction AND analogy)", "machine learning +(\"induction is like\")", "machine learning +(\"induction is similar\")", "machine learning +(\"just as induction\")", "machine learning +(\"induction can be thought of as\")", "machine learning +(\"induction can be compared to\")"]}
