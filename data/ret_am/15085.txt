If using scikit learn there is an inbuilt function which plots the ROC once actual and predicted labels are feeded into it. Otherwise, you can also manually plot ROC curve.

A perfect fitting model has an area of 1 under the ROC curve, whereas a random guessing model has an area of one-half under the ROC curve. The C statistic measures the area under the curve and is used as a model performance assessment statistic to choose between competing models.
