For the Vaihingen dataset, this is reversed, with a recall even slightly above S (L v \u222a L e), but a significantly reduced mean IoU. As all these methods used both data sources, it is evident that data fusion is crucial for high quality results. However, reasonable results could also be obtained even with single sensor data.
