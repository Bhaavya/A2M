Introduction In an effort to try to automate the <b>learning</b> of the structure of musical compositions, we recognize that music, like natural language, has a \u201cdeep structure\u201d that is difficult to represent. One barrier lies in our ability to even understand the semantics of music. The computer music society is interested in the generation and representation of music, and ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-08-30T18:49:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], [{"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.0", "name": "<b>OVERVIEW OF NEURAL NETWORKS</b> - BEN BEST", "url": "https://www.benbest.com/computer/nn.html", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.benbest.com/computer/nn.html", "snippet": "The <b>learning</b> and memory properties of neural networks resemble the properties of human <b>learning</b> and memory.
