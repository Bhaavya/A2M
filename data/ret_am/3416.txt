However, injecting pressurised fluids into the deep underground can induce earthquakes, hence converting CO2-related risk into seismic risk. Induced seismicity hazard is characterised by the overall seismic activity afb that is normalised by the injected fluid volume V and the parameter b of the Gutenberg&amp;ndash;Richter law. The (afb,b) set has so far been estimated for a dozen of ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-12-23T14:38:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}]], "all_bing_queries": ["+(hazard)  is like +(a hazardous chemical)", "+(hazard) is similar to +(a hazardous chemical)", "+(hazard) can be thought of as +(a hazardous chemical)", "+(hazard) can be compared to +(a hazardous chemical)", "cybersecurity +(hazard AND analogy)", "cybersecurity +(\"hazard is like\")", "cybersecurity +(\"hazard is similar\")", "cybersecurity +(\"just as hazard\")", "cybersecurity +(\"hazard can be thought of as\")", "cybersecurity +(\"hazard can be compared to\")"]}
