In clustering or cluster analysis in R, we attempt to group objects with similar traits and features together, such that a larger set of objects is divided into smaller sets of objects. The objects in a subset are more similar to other objects in that set than to objects in other sets. Clustering is not an algorithm, rather it is a way of solving classification problems.
