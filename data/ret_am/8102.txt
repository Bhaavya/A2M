All the methods above rely somewhat on transfer <b>learn-ing</b> with the hope that representations learned in one domain can be applied to another one. Meta-<b>learning</b> takes a different approach by trying to learn an inductive bias on a distribu-tion of similar tasks that can be utilized to build models from very few examples.
