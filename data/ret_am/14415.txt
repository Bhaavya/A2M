With an extra blank class, the CTC implicitly converts recognizing a sequence into classifying each timestep within the sequence. But the CTC loss is not intuitive for such classification task, so the class imbalance within each sequence, caused by the overwhelming blank timesteps, is a knotty problem. In this paper, we define ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-11-30T10:45:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.2", "name": "Neural network augmented wave-equation simulation", "url": "https://slim.gatech.edu/Publications/Public/TechReport/2019/siahkoohi2019TRnna/siahkoohi2019TRnna.html", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://slim.gatech.edu/Publications/Public/TechReport/2019/siahkoohi2019TRnna/...", "snippet": "We describe how we augment low-fidelity physics with <b>learning</b> techniques to handle incomplete and/or inaccurate physics, where the low-fidelity physics is modeled via finite-difference method with a poor discretization of the Laplacian. To ensure accuracy, the temporal and spatial discretization in high-fidelity wave-equation simulations have to be chosen very fine, typically one to two orders of magnitude smaller than Nyquist sampling rate.
