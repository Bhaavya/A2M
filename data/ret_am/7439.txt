The chain-like structure of RNNs are related to sequences, be it sequence of words, audio or images. For this reason, they are used with incredible success for language modeling, translation, speech recognition etc. But RNNs struggle to connect information, when the gap grows, between relevant information and the place that it\u2019s needed.
