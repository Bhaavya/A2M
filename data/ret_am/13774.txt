Finite automata are a ubiquitous formalism that is simple enough to model many real-life systems and phenomena, and they enjoy a large variety of theoretical properties: automata are closed under Boolean operations, have decidable emptiness and equivalence checking procedures, and can be ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-12-06T12:40:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], []], "all_bing_queries": ["+(lambda)  is like +(riding a bike)", "+(lambda) is similar to +(riding a bike)", "+(lambda) can be thought of as +(riding a bike)", "+(lambda) can be compared to +(riding a bike)", "machine learning +(lambda AND analogy)", "machine learning +(\"lambda is like\")", "machine learning +(\"lambda is similar\")", "machine learning +(\"just as lambda\")", "machine learning +(\"lambda can be thought of as\")", "machine learning +(\"lambda can be compared to\")"]}
