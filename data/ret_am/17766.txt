At one level, chemistry is about matter and its transformations. This is the level at which we can actually see the changes, as when a fuel burns, a leaf changes color in the fall (Fig. 2), or magnesium burns brightly in air (Fig. 3). This level is the macroscopic level, the level dealing with the properties of large, visible objects.
