A DC bias is applied to the battery to shift its operating point to the nonlinear region of current and overpotential. An alternating current of a low amplitude (AC) is simultaneously superimposed in order to investigate the system additionally in the time domain.", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-31T18:23:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}]], "all_bing_queries": ["+(ohm's law)  is like +(traffic light)", "+(ohm's law) is similar to +(traffic light)", "+(ohm's law) can be thought of as +(traffic light)", "+(ohm's law) can be compared to +(traffic light)", "science +(ohm's law AND analogy)", "science +(\"ohm's law is like\")", "science +(\"ohm's law is similar\")", "science +(\"just as ohm's law\")", "science +(\"ohm's law can be thought of as\")", "science +(\"ohm's law can be compared to\")"]}
