An <b>adversary can be thought of as</b> another part \u2010\u2010 albeit a malicious one \u2010\u2010 of the system of systems. An actor is malicious if they attempt to modify, subvert, or in any other way cause the cyber or cyber\u2010physical system to behave beyond the limits of its intended operation. For purposes of the remainder of this paper, we will explore AIS in some detail as an example of the application of this analysis. 3 AIS BACKGROUND The ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-08-13T20:51:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.1", "name": "Casper: A Compiler for the Analysis of Security Protocols", "url": "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2381287_Casper_A_Compiler_for_the_Analysis_of_Security_Protocols", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2381287_Casper_A_Compiler_for_the_Analysis_of...", "snippet": "The <b>adversary can be thought of as</b> the parallel composition of n processes, one for each of n facts or messages that the adversary may learn during the execution of the protocol. ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-05T06:46:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.2", "name": "<b>Dataset Shift in Machine Learning</b> - PDF Free Download", "url": "https://epdf.pub/dataset-shift-in-machine-learning.html", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://epdf.pub/<b>dataset-shift-in-machine-learning</b>.html", "snippet": "qui\u00d1onero-candela, sugiyama, schwaighofer, and lawrence, editors computer science/machine learning <b>dataset shift in machine learning</b> <b>dataset shift in machine learning</b> edited by joaquin qui\u00d1onero-candela, masashi sugiyama, anton schwaighofer, and neil d. lawrence", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-11-28T10:17:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], []], "all_bing_queries": ["+(adversary)  is like +(an online attacker)", "+(adversary) is similar to +(an online attacker)", "+(adversary) can be thought of as +(an online attacker)", "+(adversary) can be compared to +(an online attacker)", "cybersecurity +(adversary AND analogy)", "cybersecurity +(\"adversary is like\")", "cybersecurity +(\"adversary is similar\")", "cybersecurity +(\"just as adversary\")", "cybersecurity +(\"adversary can be thought of as\")", "cybersecurity +(\"adversary can be compared to\")"]}
