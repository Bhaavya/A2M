By this logic, the final hidden state vector of the encoder <b>RNN can be thought of as</b> a pretty accurate representation of the whole input text. The decoder is another RNN, which takes in the final hidden state vector of the encoder and uses it to predict the words of the output reply. Let&#39;s look at the first cell. The cell&#39;s job is to take in the vector ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-30T02:41:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}], []], "all_bing_queries": ["+(rnn)  is like +(a machine learning algorithm used to predict the next word in a sequence of words)", "+(rnn) is similar to +(a machine learning algorithm used to predict the next word in a sequence of words)", "+(rnn) can be thought of as +(a machine learning algorithm used to predict the next word in a sequence of words)", "+(rnn) can be compared to +(a machine learning algorithm used to predict the next word in a sequence of words)", "machine learning +(rnn AND analogy)", "machine learning +(\"rnn is like\")", "machine learning +(\"rnn is similar\")", "machine learning +(\"just as rnn\")", "machine learning +(\"rnn can be thought of as\")", "machine learning +(\"rnn can be compared to\")"]}
