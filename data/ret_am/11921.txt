Introduction. The best way to understand something is to try and explain it. And if you keep getting better every time you try to explain it, well, that\u2019s roughly the gist of what Reinforcement <b>Learning</b> (RL) is about. Given how different RL is from Supervised or Unsupervised <b>Learning</b>, I figured that the best strategy is to go slow, and to go slow is to start with the <b>Markov</b> assumption, introduce the concept of a scalar reward and build into <b>Markov</b> Reward Processes (MRPs).Then, once our ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-02-01T06:47:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.7", "name": "<b>machine</b> <b>learning</b> - <b>Can</b> I still call a chain a <b>Markov</b> Chain if it is not ...", "url": "https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/470313/can-i-still-call-a-chain-a-markov-chain-if-it-is-not-ergodic-and-can-i-still-us", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/470313/<b>can</b>-i-still-call-a-chain-a-<b>markov</b>...", "snippet": "My answer will not be canonical: the distinguishing feature of <b>Markov</b> chains is memory loss, i.e. the next random value in the chain is independent from all the previous values when the current value is known.If your process has this <b>property</b> then you may call it <b>Markov</b> chain.", "dateLastCrawled": "2022-01-08T11:53:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.8", "name": "<b>Machine Learning Questions and Answers (Questions</b> 31 to 40) - Kindson ...", "url": "https://www.kindsonthegenius.com/machine-learning-questions-and-answers-questions-31-to-40/", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.kindsonthegenius.com/<b>machine-learning-questions-and-answers-questions</b>-31-to-40", "snippet": "Irreducibility is a <b>property</b> of a <b>Markov</b> chain that states the we <b>can</b> reach any other state in a finite time irrespective of the present state.
