However, one of the products of these reactions is hydrogen peroxide instead of NADH. In addition, peroxisomes do not contain a respiratory chain linked to ATP which results in the capture of less energy and more heat during peroxisomal p-oxidation [37]. Therefore, peroxisomal p-oxidation may be considered as an overflow pathway to oxidize fatty acids (FA) during extensive NEFA mobilization [37].
