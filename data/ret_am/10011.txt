Unfortunately, in comparisong to gradient descent, stochastic gradient is quite sensitive to the selection of a good <b>learning</b> rate. There is one more practical issues related to the use of SGD as a <b>learning</b> algorithm: do you really select a random point (or subset of random points) at each step, or do you stream through the data in order. The answer is akin to the answer of the same question for the perceptron algorithm ...", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-09-20T12:22:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.4", "name": "- <b>A Course in Machine Learning</b> - Studylib", "url": "https://studylib.net/doc/8792694/--a-course-in-machine-learning", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://studylib.net/doc/8792694/--<b>a-course-in-machine-learning</b>", "snippet": "Free essays, homework help, flashcards, research papers, book reports, term papers, history, science, politics", "dateLastCrawled": "2021-12-27T17:16:00.0000000Z", "language": "en", "isNavigational": false}, {"id": "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/api/v7/#WebPages.5", "name": "Ciml <b>v0 - 8 All Machine Learning</b> | <b>Machine Learning</b> | Prediction", "url": "https://www.scribd.com/document/172987143/Ciml-v0-8-All-Machine-Learning", "isFamilyFriendly": true, "displayUrl": "https://www.scribd.com/document/172987143/Ciml-<b>v0-8-All-Machine-Learning</b>", "snippet": "The <b>machine learning</b> algorithm has succeeded if its performance on the test data is high. 1.2 Some Canonical <b>Learning</b> Problems. There are a large number of typical inductive <b>learning</b> problems. The primary difference between them is in what type of thing theyre trying to predict.
