The frog's breathing mechanism is like the blowing of a balloon. When you blow up a balloon, air goes into the balloon through your mouth and then flows out of the tiny holes in the rubber. The frog does something similar. It takes in air through its mouth and then forces it out of its nostrils. This keeps fresh air flowing over its lungs so it can breathe easily underwater	breathing mechanism of frogs		How is breathing mechanism of frogs like blowing of the balloon?
When we blow up a balloon, the air inside it is forced out by our lungs. When we breathe in, our lungs suck in fresh air from outside. The frog's breathing mechanism is similar to this.

In both cases, there is an initial force that creates motion and a subsequent force that dissipates energy. In the case of ball striking a plate, the initial force is from the ball hitting the plate and the subsequent force is from the plate bouncing back. In anti-stokes scattering, the initial force is from light hitting an atom and the subsequent forces are from atoms absorbing and emitting light.	anti-stokes scattering		How is anti-stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
The scattering of light by an atom is very much like the collision of a billiard ball with a plate. In both cases, there is some transfer of energy from the incident object to the target. In the case of light scattering, this energy causes photons to be emitted from the target in all directions.	anti-stokes scattering		How is anti-stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
When a ball is struck by a bat, the energy from the ball is transferred to the bat. This energy causes the bat to vibrate and this vibration is what produces the sound that we hear.

Stokes scattering is like ball striking a plate because it is an interaction between two objects. In this analogy, the ball represents a photon or light particle and the plate represents a molecule in the atmosphere. When the ball hits the plate, it causes the molecules in the air to scatter. This same phenomenon occurs when photons interact with molecules in the atmosphere.	stokes scattering		How is stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
When a ball is struck by a bat, the energy in the ball is transferred to the bat. This energy causes the bat to vibrate, and some of this energy is transferred to the air around the ball.

These vibrations cause light to scatter in all directions.	stokes scattering		How is stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
When a ball is hit against a plate, the energy from the ball is transferred to the plate. This creates vibrations in the plate that spread out from where the ball hit. These vibrations are called sound waves. Sound waves can be thought of as tiny packets of energy that move through air (or any other medium). When these waves encounter an object, some of the energy is reflected off of the object and some is absorbed by it. The amount of reflection and absorption depends on how hard the wave hits the object and how big or rough the object is.	stokes scattering		How is stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?

Both ANOVA and signal detection theory compare the probability of observing a certain outcome by chance against the probability of that outcome occurring if there is a real effect. In signal detection theory, this is done by calculating the hit rate (the number of times you detect a signal divided by the total number of opportunities to detect a signal) and false alarm rate (the number of times you think you've detected a signal when there was no signal present divided by the total number of opportunities to make this mistake). In ANOVA, it's done by comparing variance between groups to variance within groups.	anova		How is anova like finding signal in the noise?
When you are looking for a signal in noise, you are trying to find something that is buried beneath other data. This can be difficult because there is so much interference. Anova is similar because it is used to find differences between groups of data. These differences can be hidden by other information, making them difficult to spot.	anova		How is anova like finding signal in the noise?
An anova is a statistical test that can be used to determine if there is a significant difference in the means of two or more groups. This test allows you to find signal (a difference between group means) in the noise (variability within groups).	anova		How is anova like finding signal in the noise?
One way to think about anova is as a tool for finding signal in the noise. In any data set, there will be some amount of variability that is due to chance alone (i.e., noise). Anova allows us to identify and account for this variability, so that we can focus on the differences between groups that are likely due to real differences in treatment or experience.	anova		How is anova like finding signal in the noise?
When you are looking for a signal in the noise, you are trying to find something that is there despite the fact that it may be difficult to see.

The hypothalamus is like a thermostat because it regulates the body's temperature.	thermostat		How is thermostat like hypothalamus?
The hypothalamus is a small, but important, part of the brain that helps to control body temperature. It does this by sending messages to the thyroid gland, which controls how fast the body burns energy (metabolism). The hypothalamus also helps to control other important functions such as hunger, thirst and sleep. A thermostat in your home works in a similar way; it sends messages to the furnace or air conditioner to turn on or off based on the temperature that you set.	thermostat		How is thermostat like hypothalamus?
In the hypothalamus, temperature sensors in the skin relay information to the brain about how warm or cool the body is. The hypothalamus then sends messages to the body's muscles and organs to help maintain a constant internal temperature. A thermostat in your home works similarly by sensing the air temperature and sending messages to your furnace or air conditioner to keep your house at a comfortable temperature.	thermostat		How is thermostat like hypothalamus?
The hypothalamus is responsible for regulating the body's temperature. It does this by releasing hormones that control how much energy the body produces and how it distributes heat. A thermostat also regulates the body's temperature by releasing hormones that control how much energy the furnace produces and how it distributes heat.	thermostat		How is thermostat like hypothalamus?
The hypothalamus is responsible for maintaining the body's internal temperature, and a thermostat does essentially the same thing.	thermostat		How is thermostat like hypothalamus?
The level of water in a dam or reservoir is determined by the difference between the inflow and outflow of water. Incoming water (inflow) flows into the reservoir faster than outgoing water can flow out, so the level of the water rises. If incoming and outgoing water are equal, then the level remains stable. Chemical equilibrium works in a similar way: The concentration of chemicals in a solution is determined by the difference between the influx and efflux of those chemicals. Incoming chemical molecules flow into a solution faster than exiting molecules can leave, so the concentration of chemicals increases until equilibrium is reached.	chemical equilibrium		How is chemical equilibrium like water level in dam and lake?
Chemical equilibrium is like water level in dam and lake because as the water level rises in the dam, it causes more water to flow into the lake. This increased level of water in the lake then causes the water level to rise in the dam. The same relationship exists between chemical equilibrium and concentration: as the concentration of a substance increases, more of that substance will be produced until equilibrium is reached.	chemical equilibrium		How is chemical equilibrium like water level in dam and lake?

The chemical equilibrium of a solution is like the water level in a dam and lake. The water level in a dam and lake is determined by how much water flows into it and how much water flows out of it. The same is true for a solution; the concentration of each species in the solution is determined by how much of that species enters the solution and how much leaves the solution.	chemical equilibrium		How is chemical equilibrium like water level in dam and lake?
Just as a dam can hold back water to create a reservoir or lake, a chemical equilibrium can "hold back" reactants and products so that the reaction does not go to completion.	chemical equilibrium		How is chemical equilibrium like water level in dam and lake?

When you turn on a light switch, electric current flows through the wires of the circuit like air flowing through a tube. The electrons in the wire are like molecules of air, and when you flip the switch, it's just like turning on a fan to blow more air through the tube.	electric circuit		How is electric circuit like air flowing through a tube?
An electric circuit is like air flowing through a tube in that it requires a continuous flow of something in order to work. In the case of an electric circuit, that "something" is electricity. Just as you need to keep air flowing through a tube for it to power a fan or other device, you need to keep electricity flowing through a circuit for it to function.	electric circuit		How is electric circuit like air flowing through a tube?
Electricity flows through metal wires in a circuit much like air flows through tubes. Electricity is forced to flow through the metal wires by a power source, such as a battery. Just as air can be forced to flow through a tube by blowing on it, electricity can be forced to flow through a wire by applying pressure to it.	electric circuit		How is electric circuit like air flowing through a tube?
Electric current is like a flow of water through a pipe. Just as the water can flow freely if there are no obstructions in the pipe, electric current flows freely through metal wires. If you block the water flow by inserting a plug into the pipe, the pressure behind the plug will increase until it overcomes the resistance of the plug and bursts it free. In a similar way, an electric current will try to flow through any obstruction in its path, such as a resistor. The greater the resistance, the higher the voltage needed to push enough current through to make sparks fly.	electric circuit		How is electric circuit like rope through metal rings?
Electricity is like a flow of water through pipes. Just as water flows easily through pipes that are large in diameter, electricity flows easily through wires that have large diameters. Just as water can be slowed down or stopped by plugging up the holes in the pipe with your fingers, electricity can be slowed down or stopped by plugging up the holes in the wire with electrical plugs.	electric circuit		How is electric circuit like rope through metal rings?
Electricity is like a current of water through a series of metal rings. Just as the flow of water can be controlled by shutting off certain valves, electricity can be controlled with switches.	electric circuit		How is electric circuit like rope through metal rings?
Electricity flows through a wire like water flows through a hose. If you put metal rings close together, the water will flow more easily through the smaller opening. The same is true for electricity. If you have a lot of wires close together, the electricity can flow more easily. This is called a circuit.	electric circuit		How is electric circuit like rope through metal rings?
An electric circuit is like a rope through metal rings in that it provides a path for electricity to flow. The ropes are the wires, and the metal rings are the electrical connectors called terminals. When you plug something into an outlet, your body completes the circuit by providing a path for the electricity to flow from the outlet to the device plugged in.	electric circuit		How is electric circuit like rope through metal rings?
The hydrophobic effect can be like teenagers at a party in that it is attracted to other hydrophobic molecules and repels water.	hydrophobic effect		How is hydrophobic effect like teenagers at a party?
The hydrophobic effect is like teenagers at a party in that it is attracted to other things that are also not water. In the case of the party, it would be teens who are drawn to each other because they share common interests. With respect to water and oil, the molecules are attracted to each other because they share similar properties (they are both nonpolar).	hydrophobic effect		How is hydrophobic effect like teenagers at a party?
Hydrophobic effect is like teenagers at a party in that they are both attracted to each other. Hydrophobic molecules are drawn to each other and form clusters, while water molecules are repelled. This creates an imbalance of charge that causes the water to be pushed away from the hydrophobic molecules.	hydrophobic effect		How is hydrophobic effect like teenagers at a party?
The hydrophobic effect is like teenagers at a party in that it's shy and doesn't want to be seen.	hydrophobic effect		How is hydrophobic effect like teenagers at a party?
The hydrophobic effect is like teenagers at a party in that they are both attracted to each other. The hydrophobic effect is the force that attracts molecules of water together.	hydrophobic effect		How is hydrophobic effect like teenagers at a party?
In both cases, a signal is transmitted from one entity to another, with the goal of eliciting an appropriate response. In biological signal transduction, this transmission typically occurs within or between cells, while in threat communication it takes place between animals. In both cases, the signals can be simple or complex and can involve many different molecules. Finally, in both systems the responses can be very diverse and range from changes in behavior to alterations in physiology.	biological signal transduction		How is biological signal transduction like threat communication in animals?
In both cases, a signal is sent from one entity to another. In the case of biological signal transduction, the signal is usually a hormone or neurotransmitter that transmits information between cells. In the case of threat communication in animals, the signal is usually a warning call or display that communicates an impending threat.	biological signal transduction		How is biological signal transduction like threat communication in animals?
In both cases, a signal is sent from one entity to another, and the recipient interprets that signal in order to produce a response.	biological signal transduction		How is biological signal transduction like threat communication in animals?
Biological signal transduction is similar to threat communication in animals in that both involve a transfer of information from one entity to another. In the case of biological signal transduction, this information is used to relay instructions within a cell or between cells. Threat communication, on the other hand, uses signals to communicate danger or aggression intentions between animals.	biological signal transduction		How is biological signal transduction like threat communication in animals?
In both cases, a signal is transmitted from one entity to another, triggering a response. In biological signal transduction, the signal is usually a hormone or enzyme that travels between cells; in threat communication, the signal is typically a loud noise or visual cue that warns an animal of danger.	biological signal transduction		How is biological signal transduction like threat communication in animals?
