Coral's age calculation is more difficult to determine than tree's age calculation. Coral has a harder time being dated because it grows in colonies and individual coral polyps may not have the same growth rates. In contrast, trees grow from a single point and scientists can easily see the rings that form annually in trees as they grow; these rings can be counted to determine a tree's age.	tree's age calculation	How is tree's age calculation like coral's age calculation?
The age of a tree is calculated by counting the number of annual growth rings that are present in its trunk.

Both are examples of scattering. In ball striking a plate, the energy from the ball is transferred to the plate, causing it to vibrate. In anti-stokes scattering, light energy is transferred to particles in the medium, causing them to vibrate.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
The scattering of light by an atom is very much like the collision of a billiard ball with a plate. In both cases, there is some transfer of energy from the incident object to the target. In the case of light scattering, this energy causes photons to be emitted from the target in all directions.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
In both cases, there is a transfer of energy. In the case of ball striking a plate, the ball transfers its energy to the plate, causing it to vibrate. In the case of anti-stokes scattering, photons transfer their energy to electrons, causing them to vibrate.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
When a ball is struck by a bat, the energy from the ball is transferred to the bat. This energy causes the bat to vibrate and this vibration is what produces the sound that we hear. The same thing happens when light hits an object. The light transfers its energy to the object and this causes the object to vibrate. The difference between anti-stokes scattering and normal scattering is that in anti-stokes scattering, the vibrations are in opposite directions.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
In both cases, there is an initial force that creates motion and a subsequent force that dissipates energy. In the case of ball striking a plate, the initial force is from the ball hitting the plate and the subsequent force is from the plate bouncing back. In anti-stokes scattering, the initial force is from light hitting an atom and the subsequent forces are from atoms absorbing and emitting light.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
When a ball is projected at a plate, the ball rebounds off the plate in a different direction. This happens because when the ball collides with the plate, it transfers some of its energy to the plate. The energy that is transferred causes the atoms in the plate to move around and this movement creates resistance which pushes back on the ball causing it to rebound in a different direction. When light waves travel through a medium and collide with particles in that medium, it also causes some of the energy of those waves to be transferred to those particles. This transfer of energy causes atoms in the medium to move around and create resistance. Just like with a ball striking a plate, this resistance push back on light waves causing them to scatter in different directions.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
When a ball is hit against a plate, the energy from the ball is transferred to the plate. This creates vibrations in the plate that spread out in all directions. These vibrations are similar to what happens when light shines on an object and gets scattered in all directions.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
When a ball is hit against a plate, the energy from the ball is transferred to the plate. This creates vibrations in the plate that spread out from where the ball hit. These vibrations are called sound waves. Sound waves can be thought of as tiny packets of energy that move through air (or any other medium). When these waves encounter an object, some of the energy is reflected off of the object and some is absorbed by it. The amount of reflection and absorption depends on how hard the wave hits the object and how big or rough the object is.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
When a ball is thrown at a plate, it scatters in all directions. This is similar to what happens when light hits an object. The light scatters in all directions.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
Stokes scattering is like ball striking a plate because it is an interaction between two objects. In this analogy, the ball represents a photon or light particle and the plate represents a molecule in the atmosphere. When the ball hits the plate, it causes the molecules in the air to scatter. This same phenomenon occurs when photons interact with molecules in the atmosphere.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
The median lethal dose is like balls and target because it is a measure of how much exposure is required to kill half the members of a population.	median lethal dose	How is median lethal dose like balls and target?
The median lethal dose (LD50) is the dose required to kill 50% of a population. It can be compared to balls and a target in that it is a measure of how much something needs to be diluted in order to achieve an effect. In the case of balls and a target, if you want the balls to hit the target, you need to throw them with enough force. If you want the LD50 to hit its target, you need to administer enough of the substance until 50% of those exposed die.	median lethal dose	How is median lethal dose like balls and target?
The median lethal dose (LD) is the dose of a substance that kills 50% of the test population. It can be compared to balls and target in that it is a measure of how effective a substance is at killing. The higher the LD, the more effective the substance is at killing.	median lethal dose	How is median lethal dose like balls and target?

An anova is a statistical test that can be used to determine if there is a significant difference in the means of two or more groups. This test allows you to find signal (a difference between group means) in the noise (variability within groups).	anova	How is anova like finding signal in the noise?
One way to think about anova is as a tool for finding signal in the noise. In any data set, there will be some amount of variability that is due to chance alone (i.e., noise). Anova allows us to identify and account for this variability, so that we can focus on the differences between groups that are likely due to real differences in treatment or experience.	anova	How is anova like finding signal in the noise?
When you are looking for a signal in noise, you are trying to find something that is buried beneath other data. This can be difficult because there is so much interference. Anova is similar because it is used to find differences between groups of data. These differences can be hidden by other information, making them difficult to spot.	anova	How is anova like finding signal in the noise?
Both ANOVA and signal detection theory compare the probability of observing a certain outcome by chance against the probability of that outcome occurring if there is a real effect. In signal detection theory, this is done by calculating the hit rate (the number of times you detect a signal divided by the total number of opportunities to detect a signal) and false alarm rate (the number of times you think you've detected a signal when there was no signal present divided by the total number of opportunities to make this mistake). In ANOVA, it's done by comparing variance between groups to variance within groups.	anova	How is anova like finding signal in the noise?
An ANOVA is a technique used to identify differences between the means of two or more groups. This is done by partitioning the total variability in the data into within- and between-group components. The within-group variability reflects how much alike the scores are for members of each group, while the between-group variability reflects how different the scores are for members of different groups. If there is no difference in the means of two or more groups, then there will be no significant difference in their corresponding variances.	anova	How is anova like finding signal in the noise?
A thermostat is like the hypothalamus because they both control the body's temperature.	thermostat	How is thermostat like hypothalamus?
The hypothalamus is like a thermostat because it regulates the body's temperature.	thermostat	How is thermostat like hypothalamus?
The hypothalamus is like a thermostat because it regulates the body's temperature.	thermostat	How is thermostat like hypothalamus?

A thermostat also regulates the body's temperature by releasing hormones that control how much energy the furnace produces and how it distributes heat.	thermostat	How is thermostat like hypothalamus?
The hypothalamus is a small, but important, part of the brain that helps to control body temperature. It does this by sending messages to the thyroid gland, which controls how fast the body burns energy (metabolism). The hypothalamus also helps to control other important functions such as hunger, thirst and sleep. A thermostat in your home works in a similar way; it sends messages to the furnace or air conditioner to turn on or off based on the temperature that you set.	thermostat	How is thermostat like hypothalamus?
Water level in a dam is like the chemical equilibrium because it is constantly changing. The water level in a dam can go up or down depending on the amount of water that is released and how much water is being used. The chemical equilibrium is also constantly changing, depending on what reactions are taking place.	chemical equilibrium	How is chemical equilibrium like water level in dam and lake?
Chemical equilibrium is like water level in dam and lake because as the water level rises in the dam, it causes more water to flow into the lake. This increased level of water in the lake then causes the water level to rise in the dam. The same relationship exists between chemical equilibrium and concentration: as the concentration of a substance increases, more of that substance will be produced until equilibrium is reached.	chemical equilibrium	How is chemical equilibrium like water level in dam and lake?
Chemical equilibrium is like water level in dam and lake because at a certain point the water will stop flowing either up or down. In the same way, once a chemical reaction reaches equilibrium, it will stop moving forward or backward.	chemical equilibrium	How is chemical equilibrium like water level in dam and lake?
Just as a dam can hold back water to create a reservoir or lake, a chemical equilibrium can "hold back" reactants and products so that the reaction does not go to completion.	chemical equilibrium	How is chemical equilibrium like water level in dam and lake?
The level of water in a dam or reservoir is determined by the difference between the inflow and outflow of water. Incoming water (inflow) flows into the reservoir faster than outgoing water can flow out, so the level of the water rises. If incoming and outgoing water are equal, then the level remains stable. Chemical equilibrium works in a similar way: The concentration of chemicals in a solution is determined by the difference between the influx and efflux of those chemicals. Incoming chemical molecules flow into a solution faster than exiting molecules can leave, so the concentration of chemicals increases until equilibrium is reached.	chemical equilibrium	How is chemical equilibrium like water level in dam and lake?

Lastly, ohm's law is like cake because it is a sweet treat that everyone enjoys.	ohm's law	How is ohm's law like cats, mice and cake?
There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. It depends on what you mean by "ohm's law." If you are referring to the equation that governs electrical resistance, then ohm's law is like cake because it is a sweet and delicious treat. If you are referring to the principle that states electricity flows in a circuit when there is a voltage difference between two points, then ohm's law is like cats and mice because it is fickle and unpredictable.	ohm's law	How is ohm's law like cats, mice and cake?

Bookmarks, similarly, allow a user to quickly return to a certain passage in a text or website.	activator protein	How is activator protein like bookmarks?
In an electric circuit, the electrons flow through a metal wire like air flowing through a tube. The pressure of the air in the tube is pushing the air out of the way as it flows. In a similar way, the voltage (pressure) in an electric circuit is pushing the electrons through the wire.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit like air flowing through a tube?
Electricity is like air flowing through a tube in that it flows more freely when the path is unobstructed. If there are any obstacles in the way, the flow of electricity (or air) will be slowed down.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit like air flowing through a tube?
Electric current is like the flow of air through a tube. Just as the amount of air flowing through a tube is determined by the size of the opening and how hard you blow, the amount of electric current flowing through a wire is determined by the size of the opening (the cross-sectional area) and how much voltage is applied.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit like air flowing through a tube?
An electric circuit is like air flowing through a tube in that it requires a continuous flow of something in order to work. In the case of an electric circuit, that "something" is electricity. Just as you need to keep air flowing through a tube for it to power a fan or other device, you need to keep electricity flowing through a circuit for it to function.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit like air flowing through a tube?
Electric current is like the flow of air through a tube. Just as the speed of the air flow can be controlled by constricting or widening the opening at one end of the tube, so too can electric current be controlled by varying the width (or resistance) of the electrical conductor.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit like air flowing through a tube?
Electricity is like a rope through metal rings. The electricity flows through the metal rings and powers whatever is on the other side.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit like rope through metal rings?
Electricity is like a flow of water through a pipe. The metal rings are the pipes and the electricity flows through them just like water does.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit like rope through metal rings?
Electricity is like a current of water through a series of metal rings. Just as the flow of water can be controlled by shutting off certain valves, electricity can be controlled with switches.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit like rope through metal rings?
Electricity is like a flow of water through pipes. Just as water flows easily through pipes that are large in diameter, electricity flows easily through wires that have large diameters. Just as water can be slowed down or stopped by plugging up the holes in the pipe with your fingers, electricity can be slowed down or stopped by plugging up the holes in the wire with electrical plugs.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit like rope through metal rings?
Electric current is like a flow of water through a pipe. Just as the water can flow freely if there are no obstructions in the pipe, electric current flows freely through metal wires. If you block the water flow by inserting a plug into the pipe, the pressure behind the plug will increase until it overcomes the resistance of the plug and bursts it free. In a similar way, an electric current will try to flow through any obstruction in its path, such as a resistor. The greater the resistance, the higher the voltage needed to push enough current through to make sparks fly.	electric circuit	How is electric circuit like rope through metal rings?
The hydrophobic effect is like teenagers at a party in that it is attracted to other hydrophobic objects and repelled by water.	hydrophobic effect	How is hydrophobic effect like teenagers at a party?
The hydrophobic effect is like teenagers at a party in that they both tend to congregate together. The hydrophobic molecules (like the teenagers) will group together and avoid contact with the water (the party).	hydrophobic effect	How is hydrophobic effect like teenagers at a party?

The hydrophobic effect is like teenagers at a party in that they are both attracted to each other. The hydrophobic effect is the tendency of molecules to be repelled from water, while the teenagers are attracted to each other.	hydrophobic effect	How is hydrophobic effect like teenagers at a party?
The hydrophobic effect is like teenagers at a party in that they are both attracted to each other. The hydrophobic effect is the force that attracts molecules of water together.	hydrophobic effect	How is hydrophobic effect like teenagers at a party?
Biological signal transduction is similar to threat communication in animals in that they are both forms of communication. Biological signals are messages that cells send to one another in order to control various cellular processes, while threat communication is a way for animals to communicate their intentions or danger.	biological signal transduction	How is biological signal transduction like threat communication in animals?
In both cases, a signal is sent from one entity to another, and the recipient interprets that signal in order to produce a response.	biological signal transduction	How is biological signal transduction like threat communication in animals?
In both cases, a signal is transmitted from one entity to another, with the goal of eliciting an appropriate response. In biological signal transduction, this transmission typically occurs within or between cells, while in threat communication it takes place between animals. In both cases, the signals can be simple or complex and can involve many different molecules. Finally, in both systems the responses can be very diverse and range from changes in behavior to alterations in physiology.	biological signal transduction	How is biological signal transduction like threat communication in animals?
In both cases, a signal is sent from one entity to another. In the case of biological signal transduction, the signal is usually a hormone or neurotransmitter that transmits information between cells. In the case of threat communication in animals, the signal is usually a warning call or display that communicates an impending threat.	biological signal transduction	How is biological signal transduction like threat communication in animals?
In both cases, a signal is sent from one entity to another, and the second entity responds accordingly. In animals, this often takes the form of aggression or retreat in response to a perceived threat. In biological signaling, the responses can be much more varied and subtle, but they still serve to convey information between cells.	biological signal transduction	How is biological signal transduction like threat communication in animals?
