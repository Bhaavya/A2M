These specialized roles require communication between players so they can work together effectively on the field.In cells, different parts of the cell specialize in performing specific tasks such as producing energy, building proteins, or transporting molecules around the cell. Cells also rely on communication between their parts to carry out all of their functions efficiently. For example, when a molecule is needed in a particular part of the cell, a signal is sent from that part telling other parts where to send it. This type of communication allows cells to respond quickly and accurately to changes in their environment.	specialization and communication in a cell	How is specialization and communication in a cell like football?
In football, specialization and communication are key to the success of the team. Each player has a specific role that they play on the field in order to move the ball downfield and score points.

An audio card is like ear in that it helps people to listen to sounds. An audio card is a device that allows computers to play sound and music. It converts electronic signals into audible sounds. Analog-to-digital (A/D) converters turn analog sonic waves into digital data, which the computer can understand. Digital-to-analog (D/A) converters change the digital signals back into analog form so they can be heard through speakers or headphones.	audio card	How is audio card like ear?
The ear is an organ of the body that detects sound. It contains three parts: the outer, middle, and inner ear. The outer ear collects sound waves and directs them into the auditory canal. The middle ear amplifies sound waves and sends them to the inner ear. The inner ear converts sound waves into electrical signals that are sent to the brain.	audio card	How is audio card like ear?

The age of a tree is often calculated by counting the number of rings in its trunk. This number can be used to estimate the tree's age. Coral's age is also often calculated by counting the number of rings in its skeleton.	tree's age calculation	How is tree's age calculation like coral's age calculation?
Calculating a tree's age is similar to calculating coral's age. Both use dendrochronology, which is the study of how tree rings are formed and grow. This allows scientists to determine a tree's age and growth rate.	tree's age calculation	How is tree's age calculation like coral's age calculation?
Tree growth is based on the addition of new cells at the tips of branches. The calculation of a tree's age is based on its diameter and height. Coral growth is also based on the addition of new cells, but these are added along the surface of the coral colony. Age determination for corals is based on growth rates and knowledge about how long it takes different species to grow one millimeter in size.	tree's age calculation	How is tree's age calculation like coral's age calculation?

The scattering of light by an atom is very much like the collision of a billiard ball with a plate. In both cases, there is some transfer of energy from the incident object to the target. In the case of light scattering, this energy causes photons to be emitted from the target in all directions.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
The ball hitting the plate is an analogy for light hitting a particle. When the ball hits the plate, it causes vibrations in the plate. These vibrations spread out from where the ball hit and eventually die away. This is similar to what happens when light hits a particle. The light causes vibrations in the particles and these vibrations spread out from where the light hit and eventually die away.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
In both cases, there is an initial force that creates motion and a subsequent force that dissipates energy. In the case of ball striking a plate, the initial force is from the ball hitting the plate and the subsequent force is from the plate bouncing back. In anti-stokes scattering, the initial force is from light hitting an atom and the subsequent forces are from atoms absorbing and emitting light.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
In both cases, there is a transfer of energy. In the case of ball striking a plate, the ball transfers its energy to the plate, causing it to vibrate. In the case of anti-stokes scattering, photons transfer their energy to electrons, causing them to vibrate.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
When a ball is hit against a plate, the energy of the ball is transferred to the plate. This causes the plate to vibrate and create sound waves. The same thing happens when light hits an obstacle. The light transfers its energy to the object and creates vibrations that we see as light scattering.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
When a ball is projected at a plate, the ball rebounds off the plate in a different direction. This happens because when the ball collides with the plate, it transfers some of its energy to the plate. The energy that is transferred causes the atoms in the plate to move around and this movement creates resistance which pushes back on the ball causing it to rebound in a different direction. When light waves travel through a medium and collide with particles in that medium, it also causes some of the energy of those waves to be transferred to those particles. This transfer of energy causes atoms in the medium to move around and create resistance. Just like with a ball striking a plate, this resistance push back on light waves causing them to scatter in different directions.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
The scattering of light by a particle is similar to the scattering of a ball by a plate. The ball scatters in all directions, while the light scatters in all directions except directly back to its source.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
When a ball is hit against a plate, the energy from the ball is transferred to the plate. This creates vibrations in the plate that spread out from where the ball hit. These vibrations are called sound waves. Sound waves can be thought of as tiny packets of energy that move through air (or any other medium). When these waves encounter an object, some of the energy is reflected off of the object and some is absorbed by it. The amount of reflection and absorption depends on how hard the wave hits the object and how big or rough the object is.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
When a ball is struck by a bat, the energy in the ball is transferred to the bat. This energy causes the bat to vibrate, and some of this energy is transferred to the air around the ball. This air then vibrates, and these vibrations are what we see as sound. When light hits an object, it can also cause that object to vibrate. These vibrations cause light to scatter in all directions.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
When a ball is thrown at a plate, it scatters in all directions. This is similar to what happens when light hits an object. The light scatters in all directions.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering like ball striking a plate?
The median lethal dose is like balls and the target because it is a measure of how much something takes to kill half of the population. In this analogy, the balls are the amount of something (usually a drug) and the target is the number of people who need to be exposed to it in order for half of them to die.	median lethal dose	How is median lethal dose like balls and target?
The median lethal dose (LD50) is the dose required to kill 50% of a population. It can be compared to balls and a target in that it is a measure of how much something needs to be diluted in order to achieve an effect. In the case of balls and a target, if you want the balls to hit the target, you need to throw them with enough force. If you want the LD50 to hit its target, you need to administer enough of the substance until 50% of those exposed die.	median lethal dose	How is median lethal dose like balls and target?
The median lethal dose (LD) is the dose of a substance that kills 50% of the test population.

An ANOVA is a technique used to identify differences between the means of two or more groups. This is done by partitioning the total variability in the data into within- and between-group components. The within-group variability reflects how much alike the scores are for members of each group, while the between-group variability reflects how different the scores are for members of different groups. If there is no difference in the means of two or more groups, then there will be no significant difference in their corresponding variances.	anova	How is anova like finding signal in the noise?

The hypothalamus is like a thermostat because it regulates the body's temperature.	thermostat	How is thermostat like hypothalamus?
The hypothalamus is a small, but important, part of the brain that helps to control body temperature. It does this by sending messages to the thyroid gland, which controls how fast the body burns energy (metabolism). The hypothalamus also helps to control other important functions such as hunger, thirst and sleep. A thermostat in your home works in a similar way; it sends messages to the furnace or air conditioner to turn on or off based on the temperature that you set.	thermostat	How is thermostat like hypothalamus?

The level of water in a dam or reservoir is determined by the difference between the inflow and outflow of water. Incoming water (inflow) flows into the reservoir faster than outgoing water can flow out, so the level of the water rises. If incoming and outgoing water are equal, then the level remains stable. Chemical equilibrium works in a similar way: The concentration of chemicals in a solution is determined by the difference between the influx and efflux of those chemicals. Incoming chemical molecules flow into a solution faster than exiting molecules can leave, so the concentration of chemicals increases until equilibrium is reached.	chemical equilibrium	How is chemical equilibrium like water level in dam and lake?
