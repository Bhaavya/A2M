A density wave is an example of a self-organizing system. In a traffic jam, the cars slow down and eventually stop because there are too many cars in one place. This creates a "jam" or "wave" of stopped cars. A density wave is similar to a traffic jam, but on a much smaller scale. Instead of cars, think of molecules in a gas or people in a crowd. When too many people are standing together they create a "wave" of people that move slowly through the crowd.	nature of a density wave	How is nature of a density wave analogous to traffic jam on a highway?

A neuron is like a long line of dominoes. When the first domino falls, it knocks over the next one, and so on. This is how an action potential travels down a neuron.

The analogy between action potential propagation and falling dominoes is that when the first domino falls, it knocks over the next one, which in turn knocks over the next one, and so on. In a similar way, when an action potential propagates down a neuron, it causes voltage-gated ion channels to open in the membrane of the next neuron, which allows ions to flow into or out of the neuron. This then causes the membrane potential of the next neuron to change, which can propagate the action potential further along the chain of neurons.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	How is propagation of an action potential down a neuron analogous to falling dominoes?

In both cases, there is a limited amount of something that is being shared among people or entities. With chocolate distribution, the analogy would be that each person gets an equal share of the chocolate.

In glycolysis, glucose is moved from one compartment to another in cells. The movement of glucose creates a type of potential energy called Gibbs free energy. Glucose is moved from an area where there is less Gibbs free energy to an area where there is more Gibbs free energy. This process happens repeatedly as glycolysis proceeds	glycolysis	How is glycolysis analogous to roller coaster?
When a ball is struck against a plate, it creates vibrations that spread out in all directions. These vibrations are analogous to the light waves scattered by an object.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering analogous to ball striking a plate?
In anti-stokes scattering, a particle is scattered by another particle in the opposite direction as the original. For example, if a ball is thrown at a plate and bounces off, the reverse happens with anti-stokes scattering. The ball would be scattered away from the plate instead of towards it.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering analogous to ball striking a plate?
In both cases, there is a transfer of energy from one object to another. In ball striking a plate, the energy from the ball is transferred to the plate, causing it to vibrate. In anti-stokes scattering, the energy from the light beam is transferred to the atom, causing it to vibrate.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering analogous to ball striking a plate?
When a ball is thrown at a plate, the ball rebounds off of the plate. This is analogous to anti-stokes scattering, where light rebounces off of an object.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering analogous to ball striking a plate?
When a ball is hit against a plate, it creates ripples that spread outward. These ripples are analogous to the light waves scattered by an object in anti-Stokes scattering.	anti-stokes scattering	How is anti-stokes scattering analogous to ball striking a plate?
When a ball is thrown at a plate, the ball rebounds off of the plate in a different direction. This occurs because when the ball hits the plate, it causes some of the energy from the ball to be transferred to the plate. This then causes the plate to vibrate and this vibration is what causes the rebound.Stokes scattering is very similar to this. When light hits an object, some of its energy is transferred to the object. This then causes the object to vibrate and this vibration is what scatters light in all directions.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering analogous to ball striking a plate?
In stokes scattering, a light source emits light waves into a medium. Some of the waves pass through the medium while others are scattered by objects in the medium. In ball striking a plate, a ball is projected at a surface and some of the energy from the ball is transferred to the object it hits while some is lost to other directions.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering analogous to ball striking a plate?
When a ball is thrown at a plate, the ball scatters off of the plate in all directions. This is similar to what happens when light hits an object. The light scatters off of the object in all directions.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering analogous to ball striking a plate?
In both situations, a projectile is interacting with a surface. In stokes scattering, the projectile is a light ray and the surface is an obstacle. In ball striking a plate, the projectile is a ball and the surface is a flat plane. Both interactions cause some of the energy of the projectile to be dissipated as it interacts with the surface.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering analogous to ball striking a plate?
Stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate in that they are both examples of elastic scattering. In both cases, the objects involved exchange energy with each other after colliding.	stokes scattering	How is stokes scattering analogous to ball striking a plate?

The universe is analogous to the surface of a balloon in that it is constantly expanding.	universe	How is universe analogous to surface of a balloon?
A balloon is a good analogy for the universe because, like a balloon, the universe has an outer surface and an inner volume. The outer surface of a balloon is called the skin; it's where you can see the wrinkles and folds in the rubber. The inner volume of a balloon is filled with air; it's what you blow up to make the balloon bigger.Just as you can blow up a balloon to different sizes, so too can astronomers inflate our model of the universe by making different assumptions about its beginning, end, and overall shape. For example, if we assume that inflation stopped at some point early in cosmic history, then we get a universe that looks like a big inflated ball. If instead we assume that inflation continued forever (à la Alan Guth), then we get something more like a infinite plane or sheet.	universe	How is universe analogous to surface of a balloon?

Chemical equilibrium is analogous to water level in dam and lake because both the chemical equilibrium and water level depend on how much material is inputted or taken out of the system. With too much inflow, the water level rises, and with too much outflow, the water level falls.
