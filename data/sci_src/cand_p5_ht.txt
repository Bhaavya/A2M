This process is similar to how a balloon fills with air when you blow into it and deflates when you let go of the balloon.	breathing mechanism of frogs		How is breathing mechanism of frogs analogous to blowing of the balloon?
Blowing up a balloon is similar to how frogs breathe. When you blow up a balloon, you are forcing air into the balloon. This causes the balloon to inflate and get bigger. Frogs also inflate their lungs by breathing in air.	breathing mechanism of frogs		How is breathing mechanism of frogs analogous to blowing of the balloon?
The balloon analogy is appropriate because when you blow into a balloon, the air inside the balloon expands. This causes the elastic material of the balloon to stretch. The frog's lungs work in a similar way. When it breathes in, its ribcage expands and pulls on the lungs. This causes them to inflate and fill with air.	breathing mechanism of frogs		How is breathing mechanism of frogs analogous to blowing of the balloon?
A layered architecture is analogous to communication with translators because it allows different parts of the system to communicate with each other without having to understand the complexities of how each part works.

In both cases, communication is more efficient and accurate when it flows through a translator or layer.	layered architecture		How is layered architecture analogous to communication with translators?
Just as communication with translators allows for people who speak different languages to effectively communicate with one another, layered architecture allows different parts of a software system to communicate effectively with one another.

A roller coaster analogy for glycolysis is that it is like riding a roller coaster. The ride starts out slowly, but then it quickly speeds up and reaches the top of the track. The ride then comes back down to the bottom and ends with a slow stop. This is similar to how glycolysis works because it starts out slowly by using only one glucose molecule, but then it quickly uses up all of the glucose molecules and ends with a slow stop.	glycolysis		How is glycolysis analogous to roller coaster?
Both glycolysis and a roller coaster are processes that involve energy. In the case of glycolysis, this energy is harnessed from glucose molecules to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP). With a roller coaster, this energy is harnessed from potential and kinetic energy in order to move riders up and down hills.	glycolysis		How is glycolysis analogous to roller coaster?
Anti-stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate in that they are both examples of elastic collisions. In anti-stokes scattering, photons collide with another atom and recoil in the opposite direction.

The median lethal dose (LD50) is the amount of a substance that kills half of the test population in a controlled setting. It can be thought of as analogous to balls and target because it is a measure of how deadly something is. The more balls you have, the closer they will be to the target. Similarly, the more LD50s you have, the closer they will be to 50%.	median lethal dose		How is median lethal dose analogous to balls and target?

A balloon is a good analogy for the universe because, like a balloon, the universe has an outer surface and an inner volume. The outer surface of a balloon is called the skin; it's where you can see the wrinkles and folds in the rubber. The inner volume of a balloon is filled with air; it's what you blow up to make the balloon bigger.Just as you can blow up a balloon to different sizes, so too can astronomers inflate our model of the universe by making different assumptions about its beginning, end, and overall shape. For example, if we assume that inflation stopped at some point early in cosmic history, then we get a universe that looks like a big inflated ball. If instead we assume that inflation continued forever (à la Alan Guth), then we get something more like a infinite plane or sheet.	universe		How is universe analogous to surface of a balloon?

One way to think of chemical equilibrium is that it is analogous to the water level in a dam and lake. The water level in a dam and lake can be thought of as being in equilibrium because the amount of water flowing into the reservoir (the dam) is equal to the amount of water flowing out of the reservoir. In a similar way, chemical equilibrium occurs when the rate at which molecules are entering and leaving a system are equal.	chemical equilibrium		How is chemical equilibrium analogous to water level in dam and lake?
The water level in a dam and lake is analogous to chemical equilibrium because both are regulated by the balance of forces. In the case of the water level, gravity and other physical properties create a force that pulls the water down, while atmospheric pressure creates a force that pushes the water up. These two opposing forces create equilibrium, which is when the water levels stay constant. In a similar way, chemical equilibria are created by opposing forces such as enthalpy (heat) and entropy (disorder). When these two forces are balanced, the reaction reaches equilibrium.	chemical equilibrium		How is chemical equilibrium analogous to water level in dam and lake?
Chemical equilibrium is analogous to water level in dam and lake because both the chemical equilibrium and water level depend on how much material is inputted or taken out of the system. With too much inflow, the water level rises, and with too much outflow, the water level falls. In a similar way, if more reactants are introduced into a chemical reaction than products are removed, then the concentration of reactants will increase until an equilibrium is reached where the rate of production equals the rate of consumption.	chemical equilibrium		How is chemical equilibrium analogous to water level in dam and lake?
