Replication is similar to a photocopier machine because they are both copying mechanisms.	dna replication	How is dna replication similar to photocopier machine?
A photocopier machine makes an image of a document by projecting light onto the document and then using a lens to create a copy of the image. The lens projects the image of the document onto a photosensitive drum, which is coated with a special material that changes color when exposed to light. A series of electrical charges cause toner (a fine black powder) to be attracted to the areas of the drum where light was shone on the original document. Paper is then passed over the drum, causing it to pick up some of the toner. The paper is then heated and pressure is applied, causing the toner particles on the paper to fuse together and form an exact replica of the original document.	dna replication	How is dna replication similar to photocopier machine?

Cities are built on an ecosystem of people, resources, and infrastructure. The same is true for ecosystems – they are built on a foundation of plants, animals, and soil. Cities need resources such as water and energy to function, and so do ecosystems. And finally, cities rely on infrastructure such as roads and bridges to connect people and places. The same is true for ecosystems – they rely on physical features such as rivers and mountains to help connecting different parts of the system.	ecosystem	How is ecosystem similar to cities?

Propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes because it is a sequential process that involves the transfer of energy from one neuron to the next.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	How is propagation of an action potential down a neuron similar to falling dominoes?
The propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes because when the first domino falls, it knocks over the next one and so on.

Propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes in that the action potential travels down the neuron in a wave-like fashion.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	How is propagation of an action potential down a neuron similar to falling dominoes?
When the first domino falls, it knocks over the second one, which in turn knocks over the third one, and so on. This is similar to how an action potential travels down a neuron. When the first ion channel opens, it allows sodium ions to flow into the neuron. This causes the membrane potential to change, which then opens more ion channels. This allows even more sodium ions to enter the neuron, which causes the membrane potential to change even more. This continues until all of the ion channels are open and there is a big influx of sodium ions into the neuron.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	How is propagation of an action potential down a neuron similar to falling dominoes?
An action potential is a nerve impulse that travels down an axon. The falling dominoes analogy is a good way to understand how an action potential works. Each domino represents a molecule of sodium (Na+). When the first domino falls, it knocks over the next one, which then knocks over the next one, and so on. An action potential works in much the same way. A nerve cell begins to fire when it's ion channels open and allow Na+ ions to flow into the cell. This influx of Na+ ions causes more channels to open, which leads to even more Na+ ions entering the cell. This process builds until there's enough voltage at the end of the axon for an Action Potential	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	How is propagation of an action potential down a neuron similar to falling dominoes?
The frog's breathing mechanism is similar to blowing of the balloon because they both use air sacs. The frog has two sacs, one on each side of its body. When it breathes in, the air goes into these sacs and when it breathes out, the air comes out of these sacs.	breathing mechanism of frogs	How is breathing mechanism of frogs similar to blowing of the balloon?
Breathing mechanism of frogs is similar to blowing of the balloon because when you blow up a balloon, you are forcing air into the balloon. When you breathe in, you are sucking in air. Frogs use their lungs to suck in air and they also have a special sac called the plastron which helps them breathe under water.	breathing mechanism of frogs	How is breathing mechanism of frogs similar to blowing of the balloon?
The frog's breathing mechanism is similar to the blowing of a balloon in that they both use air pressure. The frog uses its throat muscles to suck in air and then close off its nose so that the air pressure inside its body cavity increases. This causes the lungs to inflate like a balloon.	breathing mechanism of frogs	How is breathing mechanism of frogs similar to blowing of the balloon?
The balloon analogy is a good way to think of how the lungs work. The air inside the balloon is like the air in the lungs. When you blow into the balloon, you are pushing air into it. This inflates (pushes) the balloon and makes it bigger. When you stop blowing, the air inside the balloon slowly leaks out until it becomes flat again. This same thing happens with your lungs. When you breathe in, you push fresh air into your lungs. This inflates them and makes them bigger. When you breathe out, stale air leaves your lungs and they become smaller again	breathing mechanism of frogs	How is breathing mechanism of frogs similar to blowing of the balloon?
In both cases, air is forced into and out of something. In the case of a frog, the air is forced in and out of its lungs. In the case of a balloon, the air is forced in and out of the balloon.	breathing mechanism of frogs	How is breathing mechanism of frogs similar to blowing of the balloon?

A limiting reactant is like a chocolate bar that is only partially eaten. There are still some pieces of chocolate left, but not as many as there were at the beginning.

A prokaryotic cell contains all the genetic information it needs to function on its own, whereas a self-started business typically has a limited number of employees who can manage operations without outside help.

Finally, both can be difficult to maintain over the long term without continued effort.	prokaryotic cell	How is prokaryotic cell similar to self started business?
In a prokaryotic cell, the DNA is not enclosed within a membrane-bound nucleus. In contrast, the DNA in eukaryotic cells is sequestered within the nucleus. This structural difference reflects a fundamental distinction between these two types of cells: Prokaryotes are generally simpler and lack many of the internal cellular organelles found in eukaryotes. Eukaryotic cells evolved from prokaryotic cells, probably through the acquisition of endosymbiotic organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts.	prokaryotic cell	How is prokaryotic cell similar to self started business?
