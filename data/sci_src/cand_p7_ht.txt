Ecosystems are similar to cities in that they both have a variety of different parts that work together to form a whole. In an ecosystem, there are producers (plants), consumers (animals), and decomposers (microorganisms). These parts all interact with one another to create a functioning system.	ecosystem		How is ecosystem similar to cities?
Cities are built on an ecosystem of people, resources, and infrastructure. The same is true for ecosystems – they are built on a foundation of plants, animals, and soil. Cities need resources such as water and energy to function, and so do ecosystems. And finally, cities rely on infrastructure such as roads and bridges to connect people and places. The same is true for ecosystems – they rely on physical features such as rivers and mountains to help connecting different parts of the system.	ecosystem		How is ecosystem similar to cities?

Propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes because it is a sequential process that involves the transfer of energy from one neuron to the next.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron		How is propagation of an action potential down a neuron similar to falling dominoes?
Propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes in that the action potential travels down the neuron in a wave-like fashion.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron		How is propagation of an action potential down a neuron similar to falling dominoes?
The propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes in that once the first domino falls, it triggers the next one, and so on. The same is true for an action potential; once it starts flowing down a neuron, it triggers the next one, which then triggers the next one, and so on. This process allows information to be transmitted quickly and efficiently throughout the nervous system.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron		How is propagation of an action potential down a neuron similar to falling dominoes?
An action potential is similar to falling dominoes because when one section of the neuron fires, it causes a wave of depolarization that travels down the neuron. This wave of depolarization eventually reaches the end of the neuron and triggers an action potential there.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron		How is propagation of an action potential down a neuron similar to falling dominoes?
An action potential is like a domino that falls over and knocks over the next one. The first domino is the neuron's voltage-gated sodium channels, which open when the neuron fires an action potential. This allows positively charged sodium ions to flow into the neuron. The influx of sodium ions causes more voltage-gated sodium channels to open, which leads to even more positive charge flowing into the neuron. This creates a wave of depolarization that travels down the neuron until it reaches its terminal where it triggers another action potential.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron		How is propagation of an action potential down a neuron similar to falling dominoes?
Breathing mechanism of frogs is similar to blowing of the balloon because when you blow up a balloon, you are forcing air into the balloon. When you breathe in, you are sucking in air.

The frog's breathing mechanism is similar to blowing of the balloon because they both use air sacs. The frog has two sacs, one on each side of its body. When it breathes in, the air goes into these sacs and when it breathes out, the air comes out of these sacs.	breathing mechanism of frogs		How is breathing mechanism of frogs similar to blowing of the balloon?
The frog's breathing mechanism is similar to the blowing of a balloon in that they both use air pressure. The frog uses its throat muscles to suck in air and then close off its nose so that the air pressure inside its body cavity increases. This causes the lungs to inflate like a balloon.	breathing mechanism of frogs		How is breathing mechanism of frogs similar to blowing of the balloon?
When you blow up a balloon, the air inside the balloon is pushing outwards on the rubber of the balloon. This pushes the air out of your lungs in a process called expiration. When you stop blowing, the elasticity of the rubber pulls the balloons back towards your mouth and this causes inspiration as fresh air is taken into your lungs.A frog's breathing mechanism is similar to blowing up a balloon in that when they inhale, their chest muscles compress and suck air into their lungs. When they exhale, their chest muscles relax and push all of the old stale air out of their lungs.	breathing mechanism of frogs		How is breathing mechanism of frogs similar to blowing of the balloon?
The balloon analogy is a good way to think of how the lungs work. The air inside the balloon is like the air in the lungs. When you blow into the balloon, you are pushing air into it. This inflates (pushes) the balloon and makes it bigger. When you stop blowing, the air inside the balloon slowly leaks out until it becomes flat again. This same thing happens with your lungs. When you breathe in, you push fresh air into your lungs. This inflates them and makes them bigger. When you breathe out, stale air leaves your lungs and they become smaller again	breathing mechanism of frogs		How is breathing mechanism of frogs similar to blowing of the balloon?

Cats, mice and cake can also be measured in this way.	ohm's law		How is ohm's law similar to cats, mice and cake?
The law of conservation of energy is similar to Ohm's law in that they are both physical laws. Just as the total amount of energy in an isolated system remains constant, the total current flowing through a circuit remains constant. This analogy is not perfect because there can be losses (in heat, for example) in a real circuit, but it is useful for explaining the basic concept.	ohm's law		How is ohm's law similar to cats, mice and cake?
A potential difference (voltage) between two points in a circuit will cause current to flow through the conductor between those points. The greater the voltage, the more current that will flow. This is Ohm's law, which states that the current through a resistor is directly proportional to the voltage across it. This analogy likens Voltage to Cats, Current Flow to Mice and Resistance to Cake. Just as a higher voltage will cause more mice/current to flow than a lower voltage, so too does a higher resistance limit how much current can flow through a circuit (similar to how cake limits the number of mice that can fit).	ohm's law		How is ohm's law similar to cats, mice and cake?
