When a firefly is in a dark room, it emits light. This light is emitted as waves that spread out from the firefly in all directions. These waves interact with objects in the room and are either reflected or absorbed. The wave mechanical model of light works in a very similar way. Light is emitted as waves and these waves travel through space until they hit an object. The object either reflects or absorbs the light depending on its properties.	wave mechanical model	Explain how wave mechanical model is similar to firefly in a dark room.
When you see a firefly in a dark room, the light you see is actually emitted from the insect itself. The abdomen of the firefly contains two photostomes (light-producing organs).

The photocopier machine makes an image of a document by shining light through the document and onto a piece of photographic film. The film is then developed, resulting in a negative or positive image of the original document. DNA replication is similar to this process because it also involves the use of light. During replication, dna is exposed to ultraviolet light, which causes it to "split" or break apart into two strands. These strands are then used as templates to create new dna molecules.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is similar to photocopier machine.
The photocopier machine copies an image by projecting light onto a sheet of paper and then using a mirror to reflect the light off the page and onto a sensor. The sensor detects how much light is reflected and creates an electronic image of the page. This image is then transferred to a photosensitive drum, which coats the entire surface with an electrostatic charge. Ink is applied to the charged areas of the drum, and when it passes through the fuser unit, heat and pressure are applied, causing the ink to fuse to the paper.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is similar to photocopier machine.

Just as in a city, an ecosystem is composed of many different parts that work together to create a functioning whole. The plants and animals in an ecosystem interact with each other and their environment to create food webs and recycle nutrients. The trees provide shade, the water provides habitat, and the soil provides minerals all essential for life. In a city, the buildings provide shelter, the electricity powers lights and appliances, and the plumbing supplies clean water while wastes are disposed of.	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is similar to cities.
An ecosystem can be thought of as a city, with different types of "residents" (plants and animals) living together in close proximity. Like cities, ecosystems are constantly changing; for example, when a new animal moves into an ecosystem, the food web (the network of relationships between species in an ecosystem) changes to accommodate it.	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is similar to cities.
Ecosystems are similar to cities in that they are both systems composed of many parts that work together. In an ecosystem, the different parts include plants, animals, and microorganisms; while in a city, the different parts include buildings, businesses, and people.

Both ecosystems and cities are composed of interconnected parts that work together to achieve a common goal. In an ecosystem, the different parts may include plants, animals, air, water, and soil. In a city, the different parts may include buildings, streets, cars, and people. Both ecosystems and cities need inputs from outside sources to function properly. Ecosystems depend on sunlight and rainfall for energy and growth. Cities rely on goods and services from other places in order to survive.

The propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to the fall of dominoes because it is an all-or-none event.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes.
When one domino falls, it knocks over the next domino in line. This is similar to how an action potential travels down a neuron. When the initial action potential hits the end of the neuron, it causes a series of events that leads to another action potential traveling down the neuron.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes.
Propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes in that the first domino knocks over the second, which knocks over the third, and so on. This analogy can be further explained by looking at each domino as an individual nerve cell. The first domino (nerve cell) has an action potential that travels down its axon and causes the release of neurotransmitters at its synapse with the second nerve cell. These neurotransmitters activate receptors on the membrane of the second nerve cell, causing it to generate its own action potential. This new action potential then travels down the axon of the second nerve cell and triggers another release of neurotransmitters at its synapse with the third nerve cell. This process continues until all of the dominos have been knocked over.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes.
The propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes because when the first domino falls, it knocks over the next one, and so on. When the first action potential reaches the end of a neuron, it causes voltage-gated Na+ channels to open. This allows Na+ ions to flow into the neuron, which causes the membrane potential to become more positive. This in turn causes more voltage-gated Na+ channels to open, which allows even more Na+ ions to enter the neuron. This process continues until all of the voltage-gated Na+ channels have closed and the membrane potential has returned to its resting value.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes.
Action potentials are caused by the movement of positively charged ions into and out of a neuron. This flow of ions creates an electrical current that travels down the neuron. The action potential is similar to a falling domino because it starts with one domino (ion) hitting another, which sets off a chain reaction.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes.
When you blow up a balloon, the air in the balloon is forced out of small holes in the balloon. This causes the balloon to get bigger and bigger. The same thing happens when a frog breathes. The frog's lungs are like balloons. The air is forced out of tiny tubes in the frogs' lungs. This makes the frog's lungs get bigger and bigger until they are full of air.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is similar to blowing of the balloon.
When you blow up a balloon, the air pressure inside the balloon increases. This increase in pressure pushes on the walls of the balloon, which causes it to expand.

Every area of the bar will have the same amount of chocolate.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is similar to chocolate distribution.
A limiting reactant is like a piece of chocolate that is distributed to only a few people. There may be many pieces of chocolate, but if there are too many people trying to get their hands on them, then only a few will end up with one. An excess reactant is like a piece of chocolate that is distributed to everyone. There may be only a few pieces of chocolate, but if there are enough people around, then everyone will likely get at least one piece.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is similar to chocolate distribution.
In a chocolate distribution, there is usually one type of chocolate that is more abundant than the others. For example, in a Reese's Pieces distribution, there might be more peanut butter cups than any other type of chocolate. This same principle can be applied to chemical reactions. In a reaction where two different chemicals are interacting with each other, one of the chemicals will be used up faster than the other. This means that there will eventually be more of the first chemical present than the second, just like there would be more peanut butter cups in a Reese's Pieces distribution if it was only made out of those two types of chocolate.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is similar to chocolate distribution.
When there is a limited amount of one type of chocolate, the chocolates will be distributed unevenly.

Both entities can also be difficult to change or control once they are established.	prokaryotic cell	Explain how prokaryotic cell is similar to self started business.
In prokaryotic cells, the genetic material is not enclosed within a membrane-bound nucleus.

The roller coaster analogy is a useful way to think about the process of glycolysis. The ride starts with an ascent or "activation energy" barrier, which the riders must overcome before the coaster can get moving. Once it's up and running, gravity provides the force that powers the descent down the track. In glycolysis, this corresponds to the downhill flow of electrons that carry energy from glucose molecules to create ATP.	glycolysis	Explain how glycolysis is similar to roller coaster.

The second part (the down) is when the ATP creates energy that powers the process of glycolysis.	glycolysis	Explain how glycolysis is similar to roller coaster.
When a ball is hit against a flat surface (such as a plate), the energy of the ball is transferred to the surface. This causes the surface to vibrate and create sound waves. The same thing happens when light hits a solid object - some of the light energy is transferred to the object and it starts to vibrate, creating sound waves known as optical phonons. These phonons can scatter light in all directions, similar to how ripples spread out when you throw a stone into water.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
When a ball is struck against a plate, the force of the impact creates waves that radiate outward from the point of contact.

This phenomenon is known as anti-stokes scattering.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
In both cases, there is an interaction between two objects that leads to some energy being dissipated. In the case of anti-stokes scattering, the energy is dissipated as light. In the case of ball striking a plate, the energy is dissipated as sound.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
When a ball is struck by a bat, the energy in the ball is transferred to the bat. This energy causes the atoms in the bat to vibrate.

In both cases, the objects involved collide and bounce off each other, travelling away with some of the energy from the collision.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
When a ball is hit against a plate, it rebounds in the opposite direction with some of its kinetic energy lost as heat. This process is known as stokes scattering. In both cases, atoms or molecules are struck and impart their momentum to the object rebounding off them.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
When a ball is struck by a bat, the energy from the collision is transferred to the ball. This energy causes the atoms in the ball to move faster and further apart. Some of this energy is also transferred to the air molecules around the ball. These molecules then collide with other air molecules, causing them to move faster and further apart. This process continues until most of the energy from the original collision has been dissipated.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.

The median lethal dose (LD50) is the dose of a substance that kills half of the tested animals. It is similar to balls and target in that it is a measure of how much a particular substance can harm an organism. The LD50 corresponds to the point on the x-axis at which 50% of the test subjects have died.

Anova is a statistic that is used to compare the variability of two or more groups, while finding signal in the noise is a technique used to find meaningful patterns in data sets that are obscured by random variation.	anova	Explain how anova is similar to finding signal in the noise.
Both anova and finding signal in the noise are methods of statistical analysis. They both involve identifying patterns in data that may not be apparent to the naked eye. Anova is used to compare the means of two or more groups, while finding signal in the noise can be used to identify trends in data over time or space.	anova	Explain how anova is similar to finding signal in the noise.
The goal of an ANOVA is to determine whether the means of several groups are statistically different from one another. This is done by partitioning the variance in the data into within-group and between-group components. The signal in noise analogy would be to think of the group means as the signal and the individual data points as noise. By partitioning the variance, we can get a better idea of how much of the variation in the data is due to differences between groups and how much is due to random fluctuations within groups.	anova	Explain how anova is similar to finding signal in the noise.
The goal of an ANOVA is to determine whether the means of several groups are statistically different from each other. To do this, the researcher partitions the total variance in the data into variance within and between groups. The F-test then compares the ratio of these two variances to see if they are significantly different. In both cases, the goal is to determine if there is a signal (a difference between groups) amidst noise (random variation).	anova	Explain how anova is similar to finding signal in the noise.

Both the thermostat and hypothalamus are responsible for regulating body temperature.	thermostat	Explain how thermostat is similar to hypothalamus.
A dam is a barrier that holds back water. The level of the water in the dam and lake is similar because as more water flows into the lake, it pushes against the water in the dam, causing it to rise. Similarly, when more chemicals are added to a container of chemical equilibrium, they push against each other until an equilibrium is reached where no more changes occur.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is similar to water level in dam and lake.
At equilibrium, the rates of input and output are equal. So it's like when the water level in a dam is at its maximum: the rate that water is flowing into the dam is equal to the rate that water is flowing out. And it's like when the water level in a lake is high: The rate that rainwater is pouring into the lake is equal to the rate that evaporation and runoff are removing water from the lake.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is similar to water level in dam and lake.

Ohm's law is similar to cats, mice and cake because they are all things that can be measured. Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across the conductor. This means that if you increase the voltage, the current will also increase. You can think of this as being similar to how cats and mice are both creatures that can be counted and measured. Cake is also something that can be quantified, with each slice having a certain weight or size.	ohm's law	Explain how ohm's law is similar to cats, mice and cake.
One way to think of Ohm's law is that it governs the relationships between voltage, current and resistance in electrical circuits the same way that cats, mice and cake interact in their respective ecosystems. Just as a higher concentration of cats will lead to more mouse deaths, so too will a higher voltage result in morecurrent flow (assuming all other factors remain constant). And just as adding frosting to a cake makes it more appealing to mice, increasing the resistance in an electrical circuit will reduce the amount of current that flows through it.	ohm's law	Explain how ohm's law is similar to cats, mice and cake.
There is no definitive answer to this question. It could be argued that ohm's law is similar to cats, mice and cake in the sense that they are all relatively innocuous concepts that people encounter on a regular basis. Alternatively, it could be said that each of these things has its own individual properties which make it unique. In the end, it is up to the reader to decide how they want to interpret this analogy.	ohm's law	Explain how ohm's law is similar to cats, mice and cake.
The law of conservation of energy is similar to cats, mice and cake because it states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed.	ohm's law	Explain how ohm's law is similar to cats, mice and cake.
Ohm's law states that current is directly proportional to voltage and inversely proportional to resistance. This can be compared to the saying that "cats and mice hate each other", meaning that they tend to avoid one another. In the same way, voltage and current are related as opposites - when one increases, the other decreases. Additionally, Ohm's law can be compared to a cake recipe, which requires specific amounts of ingredients in order to produce a desired outcome. Just like with cake batter, if you change one ingredient (e.g., the amount of sugar), it will affect the overall outcome (in this case, the resistance).	ohm's law	Explain how ohm's law is similar to cats, mice and cake.

In an electric circuit, the flow of electricity is analogous to air flowing through a tube. Just as the speed of the air passing through the tube depends on the diameter of the tube and on the atmospheric pressure, so too does the speed of electrons passing through a wire depend on its diameter and on electrical pressure (voltage).	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is similar to air flowing through a tube.

Electricity is a flow of electrons through a conductor, like metal. When you connect the ends of a battery to two pieces of metal, electrons flow from the negative end of the battery to the positive end. This current will cause a magnetic field to form around the wires. If you have two pieces of metal connected by a piece of wire, and you move one piece closer to or further away from the other, the strength of this magnetic field will change and so will the current in the circuit. Just like when you pull on one side of a rope tied through two metal rings, it affects how tight or loose the knot is on either side	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is similar to rope through metal rings.
When a current of electricity flows through a wire, it can be thought of as resembling a flow of water through a pipe.

If you imagine the metal wire as a rope, and the electric current as the water, then it's easy to see how electric circuits are similar to ropes through metal rings. Just as water can flow freely through a hose with no obstructions, electric current can flow freely through a metal wire without any obstacles. However, if you put an obstruction in the way of the water flow (e.g., by inserting a finger into the hose), then the water will be forced to go around the obstacle instead of passing straight through it. In much the same way, if you insert an obstacle into an electric circuit (e.g., by plugging something into an outlet), then the electrical current will be forced to go around the obstacle instead of passing straight through it.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is similar to rope through metal rings.
