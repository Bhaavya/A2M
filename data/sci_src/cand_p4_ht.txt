A cell is able to specialize its function based on the needs of the entire organism due to communication between cells.

Players need to be able to understand and execute plays correctly in order for the team to be successful.	specialization and communication in a cell		Explain how specialization and communication in a cell is similar to football.
One way to think of the specialization and communication within cells is to compare it to a football game. In both cases, there are many different players (or parts) who need to work together in order for the whole thing to function properly. The quarterback needs to be able to communicate with the other players on the field, and they all need to be able to specialize in their own positions in order to create a winning team.	specialization and communication in a cell		Explain how specialization and communication in a cell is similar to football.

If you are hiking and come to a fork in the path, you have to make a decision about which way to go. If you choose the wrong path, it will be harder to get where you want to go. The same is true for electricity. If you choose the wrong path for electrons (a bad circuit), it will be harder for them to get where they need to go, and the electric current will be weaker.	kirchoff's voltage law		Explain how kirchoff's voltage law is similar to hiking.
When hiking, you may come to a point where the trail forks. If you take the left fork, the path will lead you uphill. If you take the right fork, the path will lead you downhill. Kirchoff's voltage law is similar to this in that it states that the sum of all voltages in a circuit is equal to zero. This means that if you follow one path of a circuit (the left or right fork), then there must be an opposing voltage somewhere else in the circuit (uphill or downhill).	kirchoff's voltage law		Explain how kirchoff's voltage law is similar to hiking.

When you use a key to unlock your door, the key fits into a specific lock that is designed specifically for that key. The shape of the key is complementary to the shape of the lock, so when they are put together, they fit perfectly and create an opening (the hole) through which you can turn the doorknob to open the door. Enzymes work in a similar way. They are proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions by fitting into specific "keyholes" on molecules called substrates. When enzymes and substrates come together, they form an active site where the reaction takes place.	enzymes		Explain how enzymes is similar to key hole.

The rate-determining step is the bottleneck in a reaction. Just like at the post office, when there are long lines of customers, the line moves slowly because it's only one person at a time who can get served. In a reaction, the rate-determining step is the slowest part of the process, so it determines how quickly the reaction occurs overall.	rate-determining step of a reaction		Explain how rate-determining step of a reaction is similar to buying stamps at the post office, when there is a long line of customers.

Column chromatography separates compounds by their polarity. Compounds that are more polar will stick to the column better and will be harder to wash off than less polar compounds. This is similar to how bees and wasps can be separated because bees are more attracted to water (polar) than wasps.	column chromatography		Explain how column chromatography is similar to separating bees and wasps.
Column chromatography is very similar to separating bees and wasps. Column chromatography uses a column filled with a stationary phase (such as silica gel) to separate two or more substances based on their relative affinities for the column material. In this way, the substances are "chromatographed" (separated) one at a time.	column chromatography		Explain how column chromatography is similar to separating bees and wasps.
Column chromatography is very similar to separating bees and wasps. In both cases, the substances being separated are placed in a column and then a solvent is used to move them through the column. The difference is that with chromatography, the substances are moved by their different rates of diffusion through a stationary phase, while with bee/wasp separation, they are moved by differences in their size and weight.	column chromatography		Explain how column chromatography is similar to separating bees and wasps.
Column chromatography is similar to separating bees and wasps because it is a way to separate substances by their physical properties. In column chromatography, the substances are placed in a tube or column and then a solvent is added. The solvent will travel up the column and through the substances. The more soluble substance will move faster than the less soluble substance. This can be used to separate bee venom from wasp venom, for example.	column chromatography		Explain how column chromatography is similar to separating bees and wasps.
Both column chromatography and separating bees and wasps use the difference in size of the objects to be separated. Column chromatography uses a small tube with a filter at the bottom that is packed with a material that will attract the molecules being separated. The tube is then placed in a larger container filled with a liquid that will wash away unwanted molecules. The smaller molecules are attracted to the filter at the bottom of the tube and stay there while larger molecules are washed away. Separating bees and wasps works on a similar principle. A bee or wasp is placed in water, which causes it to sink because it is heavier than water. The bee or wasp is then put into another container of water with oil floating on top. The bee or wasp will float because it is lighter than oil but will sink again when it goes back into pure water. By switching between containers of water with different levels of oil, you can separate bees from wasps by their weight.	column chromatography		Explain how column chromatography is similar to separating bees and wasps.

As long as both jugglers keep throwing balls back and forth at the same rate, there will be no net change in the number of balls on either side of the balance. Similarly, in a chemical system with dynamic equilibrium, there will be no net change in the concentration of any molecule over time.	dynamic chemical equilibrium		Explain how dynamic chemical equilibrium is similar to two jugglers.

The wave mechanical model is similar to fireflies in a dark room because they use light to communicate.	wave mechanical model		Explain how wave mechanical model is similar to firefly in a dark room.
When a firefly is in a dark room, it emits light. This light is emitted as waves that spread out from the firefly in all directions. These waves interact with objects in the room and are either reflected or absorbed. The wave mechanical model of light works in a very similar way. Light is emitted as waves and these waves travel through space until they hit an object. The object either reflects or absorbs the light depending on its properties.	wave mechanical model		Explain how wave mechanical model is similar to firefly in a dark room.
A firefly in a dark room is emitting light waves. These waves are hitting objects and bouncing off of them. The object then emits its own light wave, which hits other objects and bounces off of them. This process continues until the light wave dissipates. This is similar to how a wave mechanical model works. A wave mechanical model uses equations to predict how waves will bounce off of each other and disperse.	wave mechanical model		Explain how wave mechanical model is similar to firefly in a dark room.
The wave mechanical model is similar to fireflies in a dark room because they are both based on the idea of particles emitting light. In both cases, the light is emitted in all directions and spreads out over time.	wave mechanical model		Explain how wave mechanical model is similar to firefly in a dark room.
A game is being played by two people and you are listening to the sounds of the game. You can hear when one person hits the ball, and then you can hear when the other person hits the ball. This is similar to how an electroencephalogram works. An electroencephalogram records electrical activity in your brain. When you hit a ball, there is a burst of electricity in your brain. An electroencephalogram will record this burst of electricity.	electroencephalogram		Explain how electroencephalogram is similar to listening to a game.

When you are listening to a game on the radio, you are hearing the sound of people talking and objects hitting each other. This is similar to what happens when your brain processes information. The electrical signals sent from your brain create waves that can be measured by an electroencephalogram (EEG).	electroencephalogram		Explain how electroencephalogram is similar to listening to a game.
Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of your brain. This test is done by placing electrodes on your scalp. Similar to listening to a game, EEG can show how active your brain is at any given time.	electroencephalogram		Explain how electroencephalogram is similar to listening to a game.
When you listen to a game on the radio, you hear the announcer's voice and the sounds of the players' movements. An electroencephalogram is similar because it records electrical activity in your brain. You can hear changes in your brain waves (similar to sounds), and these changes can be used to diagnose problems or track how well you're responding to treatment.	electroencephalogram		Explain how electroencephalogram is similar to listening to a game.
The photocopier machine uses light to create an image of a document on a special paper. This image is then copied onto multiple pieces of regular paper. DNA replication also uses light, in the form of radiation from the sun or other sources. An image (or template) of the DNA molecule is created and this image is then replicated by copying it onto multiple new DNA molecules	dna replication		Explain how dna replication is similar to photocopier machine.
A photocopier machine copies an image by projecting light onto a surface and then using a chemical process to create a duplicate of the image. DNA replication copies genetic information by projecting light (from enzymes) onto a surface (the template strand) and then uses a chemical process to create a duplicate of the image.	dna replication		Explain how dna replication is similar to photocopier machine.
The photocopier machine uses a laser to "scan" an image into digital form. This digital information is then used to create a copy of the original image using toner powder and heat. DNA replication is similar to the photocopier machine in that it also uses a laser scanner. The scanner creates a pattern of light and dark areas called a "molecular barcode." This barcode is used to create an exact replica of the original DNA molecule.	dna replication		Explain how dna replication is similar to photocopier machine.
The photocopier machine copies an image by projecting light onto a sheet of paper and then using a mirror to reflect the light off the page and onto a sensor. The sensor detects how much light is reflected and creates an electronic image of the page. This image is then transferred to a photosensitive drum, which coats the entire surface with an electrostatic charge. Ink is applied to the charged areas of the drum, and when it passes through the fuser unit, heat and pressure are applied, causing the ink to fuse to the paper.	dna replication		Explain how dna replication is similar to photocopier machine.
Dna replication is similar to a photocopier machine because it produces a copy of the original. The dna molecule is like the document that is being copied, and the new dna molecules are like the copies that come out of the photocopier.	dna replication		Explain how dna replication is similar to photocopier machine.
DNA replication is similar to book printing in that they are both methods of copying information. With DNA replication, the genetic code is copied and with book printing, text is copied.	dna replication		Explain how dna replication is similar to book printing.
DNA replication is similar to book printing in that they are both copying mechanisms. DNA replication copies the genetic information from one molecule to another, while book printing copies text from one page to another.	dna replication		Explain how dna replication is similar to book printing.

One similarity between DNA replication and book printing is that they are both processes of duplication. In both cases, something is being copied in order to create an additional copy. Additionally, both processes require some type of input or original source material. For DNA replication, this would be the genetic code present in the nucleus of a cell. For book printing, it would be the text of a book. Finally, both processes result in two identical copies of whatever was being duplicated.	dna replication		Explain how dna replication is similar to book printing.
RNA transcription is similar to language translation in that they are both processes that involve the use of a code. In order to transcribe rna, the genetic code must be first decoded into messenger rna (m-rna). This process is similar to translating a sentence from one language into another - the individual words in the sentence are first translated and then assembled into a sentence in the new language.	rna transcription		Explain how rna transcription is similar to language translation.
RNA transcription is similar to language translation in that they are both processes by which information is conveyed from one entity to another. In the case of transcription, genetic information is conveyed from DNA to RNA; in the case of translation, messenger RNA is converted into proteins.	rna transcription		Explain how rna transcription is similar to language translation.
RNA transcription is similar to language translation in that they are both processes that involve taking a set of instructions and converting them into a specific output. With RNA transcription, the input is DNA code and the output is RNA code. With language translation, the input is a sentence in one language and the output is a sentence in another language.	rna transcription		Explain how rna transcription is similar to language translation.
The process of RNA transcription is similar to the process of language translation in that they are both processes that involve the use of a code. The genetic code is used to translate DNA into RNA, and the codons in the RNA are then translated into proteins.	rna transcription		Explain how rna transcription is similar to language translation.
RNA transcription is similar to language translation in that they are both processes by which information is conveyed from one entity to another. RNA transcription occurs when the genetic code of a gene is converted into an mRNA molecule, while language translation occurs when a text is translated from one language into another. In both cases, the information being transferred is conveyed through a series of symbols that are interpreted by a translator.	rna transcription		Explain how rna transcription is similar to language translation.
Protein translation is similar to language translation in that they are both processes that convert a set of instructions into an action. In protein translation, the instructions are encoded in DNA, and the action is the production of a protein molecule. In language translation, the instructions are written in one language, and the action is the communication of those instructions in another language.	protein translation		Explain how protein translation is similar to language translation.
Protein translation and language translation both involve the use of a code to create a message. In protein translation, the code is made up of codons, which are sequences of three nucleotides. In language translation, the code is made up of letters.	protein translation		Explain how protein translation is similar to language translation.
During protein translation, the genetic code is read and converted into a specific sequence of amino acids. This process is similar to language translation in that it involves decoding a set of instructions in order to create something new.	protein translation		Explain how protein translation is similar to language translation.
In both protein translation and language translation, a message is conveyed from one person to another. In protein translation, this message is conveyed in the form of genetic code, which consists of codons (units of DNA). In language translation, this message is conveyed in the form of words and sentences. In both cases, a translator is needed to convert the message from one form to another.	protein translation		Explain how protein translation is similar to language translation.
Protein translation is similar to language translation in that they are both processes that involve the use of a code. In protein translation, the code is made up of codons, which are three-letter sequences of DNA bases that correspond to specific amino acids. In language translation, the code is made up of letters and symbols that represent sounds.	protein translation		Explain how protein translation is similar to language translation.
Ecosystems are similar to cities in that they are both systems composed of many parts that work together. In an ecosystem, the different parts include plants, animals, and microorganisms; while in a city, the different parts include buildings, businesses, and people. Like cities, ecosystems also have boundaries (an edge where one ecosystem ends and another begins).	ecosystem		Explain how ecosystem is similar to cities.
An ecosystem can be thought of as a city, with different types of "residents" (plants and animals) living together in close proximity. Like cities, ecosystems are constantly changing; for example, when a new animal moves into an ecosystem, the food web (the network of relationships between species in an ecosystem) changes to accommodate it.	ecosystem		Explain how ecosystem is similar to cities.
Ecosystems are similar to cities in that they are both composed of multiple interconnected parts that work together to create a functioning whole. The different parts of an ecosystem (e.g., plants, animals, insects, microorganisms) interact with one another and with their environment to sustain life. Similarly, the different parts of a city (e.g., businesses, homes, government institutions) interact with each other and with their environment to sustain human life.	ecosystem		Explain how ecosystem is similar to cities.
In a way, an ecosystem is like a city. In each case, there are different types of organisms that live together and interact with one another. The organisms in an ecosystem rely on one another to survive just as the people in a city rely on other people and businesses to provide goods and services.	ecosystem		Explain how ecosystem is similar to cities.
Ecosystems are similar to cities in that they are both composed of many different parts that work together. In an ecosystem, these parts might include plants, animals, and microorganisms. In a city, these parts might include people, businesses, transportation systems, and government institutions.	ecosystem		Explain how ecosystem is similar to cities.
When an action potential is generated by the cell body of a neuron, it propagates down the axon. This is similar to how falling dominoes knock over their neighbors, as each one transfers energy to the next until the final one falls. In both cases, there is a transfer of energy that causes something to happen (an action potential travels down a neuron or dominoes fall).	propagation of an action potential down a neuron		Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes.
When an action potential is generated at the dendrite of a neuron, it travels down the axon to the terminal buttons. This causes neurotransmitters to be released which then bind to receptors on the post-synaptic neuron, causing another action potential. This process is similar to dominoes falling one after the other.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron		Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes.
The propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes because when the first domino falls, it knocks over the next one, and so on. When the first action potential reaches the end of a neuron, it causes voltage-gated Na+ channels to open. This allows Na+ ions to flow into the neuron, which causes the membrane potential to become more positive. This in turn causes more voltage-gated Na+ channels to open, which allows even more Na+ ions to enter the neuron. This process continues until all of the voltage-gated Na+ channels have closed and the membrane potential has returned to its resting value.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron		Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes.
The falling dominoes analogy is used to describe how an action potential travels down a neuron. The first domino (action potential) knocks over the second one, which in turn knocks over the third, and so on. This process repeats until the message reaches the end of the neuron.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron		Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes.
Action potentials are caused by the movement of positively charged ions into and out of a neuron. This flow of ions creates an electrical current that travels down the neuron. The action potential is similar to a falling domino because it starts with one domino (ion) hitting another, which sets off a chain reaction.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron		Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar to falling dominoes.
The frog's breathing mechanism is similar to the blowing of a balloon in that both use air pressure to create movement. When you blow into a balloon, the air pressure inside the balloon increases and this increase in pressure causes the balloon to expand. The frog's respiratory system works in a similar way. The lungs are inflated with air and this increased air pressure forces blood out of the capillaries and into the veins.	breathing mechanism of frogs		Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is similar to blowing of the balloon.
The frog's breathing mechanism is similar to blowing up a balloon. When you blow up a balloon, the air inside the balloon pushes out against the rubber of the balloon. This pushing force makes the rubber stretch until it becomes thin. The same thing happens with a frog's lungs. The air inside the frog's lungs pushes out against the walls of its lungs and makes them stretch.	breathing mechanism of frogs		Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is similar to blowing of the balloon.
Inhaling and exhaling of air in our body is done by the lungs. In frogs, it is done by their skin. When you blow a balloon, you are pumping air into the balloon through your mouth. The frog does the same thing; it pumps air into its bladder (or lungs) through its skin.	breathing mechanism of frogs		Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is similar to blowing of the balloon.
The frog's breathing mechanism is similar to blowing up a balloon. The frog inhales air through its nose and mouth, and the air travels down its trachea (windpipe). The lungs expand as the air enters them, and this causes the frog's ribcage to expand. When the frog exhales, the air travels back out of its nose and mouth, and the ribcage contracts.	breathing mechanism of frogs		Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is similar to blowing of the balloon.
When you blow up a balloon, the air in the balloon is forced out of small holes in the balloon. This causes the balloon to get bigger and bigger. The same thing happens when a frog breathes. The frog's lungs are like balloons. The air is forced out of tiny tubes in the frogs' lungs. This makes the frog's lungs get bigger and bigger until they are full of air.	breathing mechanism of frogs		Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is similar to blowing of the balloon.
Layered architecture is similar to communication with translators because it provides a way for different parts of the system to communicate with each other. The translations layer allows different systems to communicate in their own language, while the layered architecture allows different parts of the system to communicate in terms that they understand.	layered architecture		Explain how layered architecture is similar to communication with translators.
A communication system with translators is similar to a layered architecture in that each layer interacts with the layer above and below it. The translator is responsible for taking the information from one language and translating it into another language so that both parties can understand what is being said. Similarly, the lower layers in a layered architecture are responsible for taking the instructions from the higher layers and formatting them into a format that the lower-level hardware can understand.	layered architecture		Explain how layered architecture is similar to communication with translators.
Layered architecture is similar to communication with translators in that it provides a way for different parts of a system to communicate with each other. In a layered architecture, each layer uses a specific language that is understood by the layer below it. This allows different parts of the system to work independently while still communicating with each other. Translators work in a similar way, translating messages from one language into another so that they can be understood by both parties.	layered architecture		Explain how layered architecture is similar to communication with translators.
Layered architecture is similar to communication with translators because it uses different systems that work together to achieve a common goal. The different systems in layered architecture are like the different languages that are used in communication with translators. Each system has its own purpose, and they all work together to create a final product.	layered architecture		Explain how layered architecture is similar to communication with translators.
Layered architecture is similar to communication with translators because it provides a way for different parts of the system to communicate without having to understand all the details. The translator can provide a simplified version of the information that each part needs, and then the parts can pass that information on to each other. This allows the system to be more modular, which makes it easier to change and update.	layered architecture		Explain how layered architecture is similar to communication with translators.
A limiting reactant is like a chocolate distributor that only has so much chocolate to give out. If there are more people wanting chocolate than the distributor has, then not everyone will get what they want and some people will end up with none. An excess reactant is like a chocolate distributor that has an unlimited amount of chocolate to give out. If there are more people wanting chocolate than the distributor has, then everyone will get what they want and there will be no leftover candy.	limiting reactant and excess reactant		Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is similar to chocolate distribution.
In a chocolate distribution, there is usually one type of chocolate that is more abundant than the others. For example, in a Reese's Pieces distribution, there might be more peanut butter cups than any other type of chocolate. This same principle can be applied to chemical reactions. In a reaction where two different chemicals are interacting with each other, one of the chemicals will be used up faster than the other. This means that there will eventually be more of the first chemical present than the second, just like there would be more peanut butter cups in a Reese's Pieces distribution if it was only made out of those two types of chocolate.	limiting reactant and excess reactant		Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is similar to chocolate distribution.
When there is a limited amount of a reactant, that reactant will be used up first. This leaves less of the reactant to combine with the excess reactant and results in an incomplete reaction. When it comes to chocolate distribution, if there is only a limited number of pieces of chocolate available, those pieces will be distributed first and there will not be enough to go around for everyone who wants some.	limiting reactant and excess reactant		Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is similar to chocolate distribution.
A limiting reactant is like a piece of chocolate that is distributed to only a few people. There may be many pieces of chocolate, but if there are too many people trying to get their hands on them, then only a few will end up with one. An excess reactant is like a piece of chocolate that is distributed to everyone. There may be only a few pieces of chocolate, but if there are enough people around, then everyone will likely get at least one piece.	limiting reactant and excess reactant		Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is similar to chocolate distribution.
A limiting reactant is like a chocolate bar that is only partially eaten. There will be some areas where there is a lot of chocolate, and other areas where there is very little chocolate. An excess reactant is like a chocolate bar that has been completely devoured. Every area of the bar will have the same amount of chocolate.	limiting reactant and excess reactant		Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is similar to chocolate distribution.
A eukaryotic cell is similar to a working office in that both are organized and have specific functions. The cells in our bodies are like the workers in an office – they each have a specific job to do in order for the body to function properly.	eukaryotic cell		Explain how eukaryotic cell is similar to working office.
Both a eukaryotic cell and an office have workers who carry out specific tasks to keep the whole functioning. In a eukaryotic cell, these workers are called organelles and include the nucleus, mitochondria, and ribosomes. Each has a specific job to do in order for the cell to survive. For example, the nucleus controls all aspects of the cell's life while the mitochondria produces energy necessary for cells to function.	eukaryotic cell		Explain how eukaryotic cell is similar to working office.
Both a eukaryotic cell and an office have a boss, workers, and support staff. The boss in the office is the person in charge of making decisions that affect the workers. The boss in the cell is called the nucleus and it makes decisions that affect all of the other parts of the cell. The workers in both structures are responsible for carrying out tasks to help keep things running smoothly. The support staff in an office provides services like cleaning, maintenance, and security. In a cell, these roles are played by proteins called enzymes which help carry out chemical reactions needed for life.	eukaryotic cell		Explain how eukaryotic cell is similar to working office.
A eukaryotic cell is similar to a working office in that both have organized structures within them that allow them to carry out specific functions. The cells have a nucleus, which contains the chromosomes that house the genetic information, and other organelles such as mitochondria and ribosomes, which are responsible for producing proteins. The office has desks, chairs, computers, and other equipment that help employees perform their tasks. Similarly, the cell has different organelles that help it carry out its specialized functions.	eukaryotic cell		Explain how eukaryotic cell is similar to working office.
In both a eukaryotic cell and an office, there is a hierarchy of workers. In the cell, this hierarchy is based on how closely related the worker cells are to the nucleus. The closer to the nucleus, the more important the job. In an office, this hierarchy is based on salary or position. The higher up in the hierarchy, the more important the job.	eukaryotic cell		Explain how eukaryotic cell is similar to working office.
Prokaryotic cells are similar to self-started businesses in that they are both autonomous and relatively simple. Prokaryotic cells contain all of the necessary components for survival within themselves, whereas a self-started business must acquire the resources it needs to function. Additionally, prokaryotic cells can reproduce without assistance, while a self-started business must attract customers in order to grow.	prokaryotic cell		Explain how prokaryotic cell is similar to self started business.
A prokaryotic cell is similar to a self-started business in that both are autonomous and rely on their own internal resources to function. A prokaryotic cell has no nucleus or membrane-bound organelles, and its DNA is not enclosed within a nuclear envelope. Similarly, a self-started business typically lacks outside investment or oversight and relies on the owner's skills and initiative to succeed. Both entities can also be difficult to change or control once they are established.	prokaryotic cell		Explain how prokaryotic cell is similar to self started business.
A prokaryotic cell is similar to a self-started business in that it is autonomous and can replicate without assistance. Like a small business, a prokaryote has limited resources and must be efficient in order to survive.	prokaryotic cell		Explain how prokaryotic cell is similar to self started business.
A prokaryotic cell is similar to a self-started business in that both are relatively simple and easy to get started. A prokaryotic cell has a small genome and few organelles, making it easier to replicate than eukaryotic cells. Similarly, a self-started business typically has a limited number of products or services and a streamlined organizational structure, making it easier to get up and running. Both also require some level of initial investment but can be profitable with minimal effort.	prokaryotic cell		Explain how prokaryotic cell is similar to self started business.
A prokaryotic cell is similar to a self-started business in that both are relatively simple and easy to get started. A prokaryotic cell has no nucleus or organelles, and consists of a single membrane surrounding the cytoplasm. A self-started business typically has few employees and a simple organization. Both also require relatively little investment to get started.	prokaryotic cell		Explain how prokaryotic cell is similar to self started business.
The college library is a vital part of the educational experience. It provides students with access to books, journals and other resources that they need for their studies. The operating system kernel is also a vital part of the computing experience. It provides users with access to programs and resources that they need for their work or play.	operating systems kernel		Explain how operating systems kernel is similar to college library.
An operating system kernel is a lot like a college library. Just as the books in a library are used to support the educational activities of students, the code and data structures inside an operating system kernel are used to support the activities of software programs running on that computer.	operating systems kernel		Explain how operating systems kernel is similar to college library.
Just as a library contains books on many different topics, an operating system kernel contains code for many different functions. Users can't see the code in the kernel, any more than they can see the code in a book's spine; but both the kernel and the library are essential to making everything work.	operating systems kernel		Explain how operating systems kernel is similar to college library.
An operating system kernel is similar to a college library in that they both provide essential services to their respective users. The college library provides access to books, journals, and other research materials while the kernel provides access to files, devices, and other system resources. Both are also responsible for managing security and permissions.	operating systems kernel		Explain how operating systems kernel is similar to college library.
In both cases, the kernel is responsible for managing access to shared resources. The library's collection of books is analogous to the operating system's file system, and each patron is like a process accessing those books. The librarian manages who can check out books and for how long, just as the kernel manages which processes are allowed to read or write files and for how long.	operating systems kernel		Explain how operating systems kernel is similar to college library.
A cup of coffee granules is like a limiting reactant because it has a specific capacity. Once the cup is full, no more coffee can be added. In the same way, a limiting reactant has a specific capacity and once it is used up, no more of that substance can be added to the reaction.	limiting reactant		Explain how limiting reactant is similar to a cup of coffee granules.
When you make a cup of coffee, you start with water and add coffee granules. The more coffee granules you add, the stronger your coffee will be. If you want to make a weaker cup of coffee, you can add less coffee granules. In the same way, when a reaction has two reactants (A and B), the limiting reactant is the reactant that is used up first.	limiting reactant		Explain how limiting reactant is similar to a cup of coffee granules.
If you have a cup of coffee with too many granules, the water will not be able to dissolve them all. This leaves some undissolved granules at the bottom of the cup. The same thing happens when there is a limit to the amount of reactant that can participate in a chemical reaction - some of the molecules remain unchanged.	limiting reactant		Explain how limiting reactant is similar to a cup of coffee granules.
A limiting reactant is like a cup of coffee granules because it determines how much coffee can be made. In the same way, a limiting reactant in a chemical reaction determines how much product can be formed.	limiting reactant		Explain how limiting reactant is similar to a cup of coffee granules.
When you make coffee, you start with a certain volume of water and add coffee granules. The more coffee granules you add, the stronger your coffee will be. If you only add a few granules, your coffee will be weak. In the same way, when a reaction takes place between two substances, one may become limiting if it is used up faster than the other.	limiting reactant		Explain how limiting reactant is similar to a cup of coffee granules.
A limiting reactant is similar to an engine because it determines how much energy can be released. In the case of a chemical reaction, the amount of energy that can be released is limited by the amount of the limiting reactant.	limiting reactant		Explain how limiting reactant is similar to engine.

A limiting reactant is like an engine in that it controls the speed of a chemical reaction. In an engine, the amount of fuel limits how fast the combustion can occur. Similarly, in a chemical reaction, the amount of a limiting reactant determines how fast the reaction can proceed.	limiting reactant		Explain how limiting reactant is similar to engine.
A limiting reactant is similar to an engine because it determines how much product can be produced. In both cases, there is a limit to the amount of output that can be generated.	limiting reactant		Explain how limiting reactant is similar to engine.

Both helicase and zipper zip are mechanisms that help to create something. Helicase helps to create DNA while zipper zip helps to create a zipper.	helicase		Explain how helicase is similar to zipper zip.
Both helicase and zipper zip use a mechanical action to join or separate two items. In the case of helicase, it uses a twisting motion to "unzip" DNA strands. This is similar to how a zipper functions; by using teeth that mesh together, the two sides of the zipper are pulled closer together, eventually separating completely.	helicase		Explain how helicase is similar to zipper zip.
DNA replication binding proteins are similar to hands holding open two strips of magnet because they hold the DNA together. The magnets will repel each other if they are not held together, just like the protein chains on the DNA molecule will repell each other if they are not held together by the replication binding proteins.	dna replication binding proteins		Explain how dna replication binding proteins is similar to hands holding open two strips of magnet.

A roller coaster is a fun amusement ride that takes you on a thrilling journey. It starts with an ascent up a hill, followed by a fast descent down the other side. Glycolysis is also a journey, but it's one inside your body. The "hill" in glycolysis is when glucose molecules are converted into two molecules of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). The "descent" is when those G3P molecules are turned back into glucose and released energy in the process.	glycolysis		Explain how glycolysis is similar to roller coaster.
The first step in glycolysis is like the loading of a roller coaster car. It takes energy to get the process started, but once it's moving it speeds along on its own.

When a ball is struck against a plate, the force of the impact creates waves that radiate outward from the point of contact. These waves interact with each other, and eventually die out as they spread further and further from the point of impact. This phenomenon is known as anti-stokes scattering.	anti-stokes scattering		Explain how anti-stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
When a ball is struck by a bat, the energy in the ball is transferred to the bat. This energy causes the atoms in the bat to vibrate. The vibrations cause waves of energy to spread out from where the ball was hit. These waves are called sound waves. Sound waves can also be produced when an object is heated up.	anti-stokes scattering		Explain how anti-stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.

Anti-stokes scattering is the process of absorbing optical phonons and converting them into heat.	anti-stokes scattering		Explain how anti-stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
When a ball is hit against a plate, the ball rebounds off the plate in the opposite direction. This is due to Newton's Third Law of Motion, which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. When the ball hits the plate, it causes an impact force which pushes the plate away from the ball. The rebounding force of the plate pushes the ball back in the other direction.	anti-stokes scattering		Explain how anti-stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
In both cases, the energy of the object is transferred to another object. In anti-stokes scattering, the energy is transferred to the surrounding medium. In ball striking a plate, the energy is transferred to the plate.	anti-stokes scattering		Explain how anti-stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
When a ball is thrown at a plate, it scatters off the surface of the plate. This scattering is due to the interaction between the ball and the atoms in the plate. When light shines on a material, it also scatters off of the atomic surfaces. This scattering is called stokes scattering.	stokes scattering		Explain how stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
Stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate because it is an elastic collision. In both cases, the objects involved rebound after colliding.	stokes scattering		Explain how stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
In both cases, there is an initial impact that creates a disturbance that radiates outward. In the case of stokes scattering, the disturbance is in the form of light waves. In the case of ball striking a plate, the disturbance is in the form of sound waves.	stokes scattering		Explain how stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
When a ball is struck by a bat, the energy from the collision is transferred to the ball. This energy causes the atoms in the ball to move faster and further apart. Some of this energy is also transferred to the air molecules around the ball. These molecules then collide with other air molecules, causing them to move faster and further apart. This process continues until most of the energy from the original collision has been dissipated.	stokes scattering		Explain how stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
Stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate in that they are both examples of elastic collisions. In both cases, the energy of the collision is conserved and the objects involved rebound with the same speed they had before impact.	stokes scattering		Explain how stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate.
The median lethal dose is the dosage of a substance that kills 50% of the test population. This analogy uses balls and target to illustrate how the median lethal dose is determined. Imagine there are 100 red balls and 100 green balls. The goal is to hit as many green balls as possible. To determine the median lethal dose, someone would start by throwing a red ball at the target. If it hits a green ball, that person would then continue throwing red balls at the target until they miss a green ball. They would then switch to throwing green balls at the target until they missed a red ball. The process would be repeated until all 100 balls have been used. The median lethal dose is reached when half of the balls (50) have been hit with one color and half (50) with the other color.	median lethal dose		Explain how median lethal dose is similar to balls and target.

It is similar to balls and target in that it is a measure of how much a particular substance can harm an organism. The LD50 corresponds to the point on the x-axis at which 50% of the test subjects have died. Just as with throwing balls at a target, increasing the dosage beyond the LD50 will result in more organisms being harmed.	median lethal dose		Explain how median lethal dose is similar to balls and target.
The median lethal dose is similar to balls and target because it is a measure of toxicity. The median lethal dose is the amount of a substance that kills 50% of the population in a given time period. This is also known as the LD50.	median lethal dose		Explain how median lethal dose is similar to balls and target.
In both cases, the median lethal dose is the point at which half of the items have been killed. In the case of balls, this would be when half of the balls have been hit by the target. In the case of a drug, it would be when 50% of those exposed to it die.	median lethal dose		Explain how median lethal dose is similar to balls and target.
The median lethal dose (LD 50 ) is the dose of a substance that kills half the members of a tested population within a designated time frame. It can be used to compare the toxicity of different substances. The higher the LD 50 , the more toxic the substance. In analogy, imagine balls being thrown at a target. The larger and heavier the ball, the more likely it is to hit and damage the target. Analogously, bigger and heavier objects have a higher LD50 than smaller objects.	median lethal dose		Explain how median lethal dose is similar to balls and target.

Enzyme mechanism is similar to lock and key in the sense that enzymes are specific for their substrates. Just as a key can only fit into a certain type of lock, an enzyme can only bind to its specific substrate. The two molecules interact in a complementary fashion, with the enzyme fitting perfectly into the active site of the substrate. This interaction allows for the efficient transfer of electrons and atoms between the two molecules, leading to catalysis.	enzyme mechanism		Explain how enzyme mechanism is similar to lock and key.
It is often difficult to detect a signal in noise because the signal may be weak or hidden among other random fluctuations. Similarly, when performing an ANOVA analysis, it can be difficult to identify the significant difference between group means when there is variability within each group. By using statistical tests, however, we can reduce the amount of variability in our data and increase our ability to detect a signal (i.e., a significant difference between groups).	anova		Explain how anova is similar to finding signal in the noise.
Both anova and finding signal in the noise are methods of statistical analysis. They both involve identifying patterns in data that may not be apparent to the naked eye.

One way to think of Ohm's law is that it governs the relationships between voltage, current and resistance in electrical circuits the same way that cats, mice and cake interact in their respective ecosystems. Just as a higher concentration of cats will lead to more mouse deaths, so too will a higher voltage result in morecurrent flow (assuming all other factors remain constant). And just as adding frosting to a cake makes it more appealing to mice, increasing the resistance in an electrical circuit will reduce the amount of current that flows through it.	ohm's law		Explain how ohm's law is similar to cats, mice and cake.
Just as an ohm is a measure of electrical resistance, so a cat is a measure of the number of mice it can catch. And just as you need more voltage to run an electric oven than to power a light bulb, so you need more cake ingredients - flour, sugar, eggs and butter - to make an impressive layer cake than you would for cupcakes.	ohm's law		Explain how ohm's law is similar to cats, mice and cake.

In an electric circuit, electrons flow through a conducting wire in the same way that air flows through a tube. In both cases, the fluid (air or electrons) is forced to move by pressure differences on either side of the barrier.	electric circuit		Explain how electric circuit is similar to air flowing through a tube.
Electricity travels through a wire in a similar way that air flows through a tube. Electricity is made up of tiny particles called electrons, which flow through the wire like air molecules travel through a tube. When an electrical current is turned on, it creates a powerful force that pushes these electrons forward.	electric circuit		Explain how electric circuit is similar to air flowing through a tube.
Electricity flows through a wire in the same way that air flows through a tube. The electrical current is like the air flow, and the voltage is like the pressure of the air.	electric circuit		Explain how electric circuit is similar to air flowing through a tube.

Electric current flows through a metal wire like water flowing through a hose. If you imagine the metal wire as a rope, and the electric current as the water, then it's easy to see how electric circuits are similar to ropes through metal rings. Just as water can flow freely through a hose with no obstructions, electric current can flow freely through a metal wire without any obstacles. However, if you put an obstruction in the way of the water flow (e.g., by inserting a finger into the hose), then the water will be forced to go around the obstacle instead of passing straight through it. In much the same way, if you insert an obstacle into an electric circuit (e.g., by plugging something into an outlet), then the electrical current will be forced to go around the obstacle instead of passing straight through it.	electric circuit		Explain how electric circuit is similar to rope through metal rings.
Electric current is like a flow of water through a pipe. The metal rings are like the pipes and the electric current is like the water.	electric circuit		Explain how electric circuit is similar to rope through metal rings.
Electric current is like a flow of electrons through a metal wire, just as water flows through a hose. Like the rings on a rope, the metal atoms in the wire are spaced evenly apart. When an electron moves past an atom, it pulls another electron behind it. This creates a chain reaction that keeps the current flowing.	electric circuit		Explain how electric circuit is similar to rope through metal rings.
Electric circuits are similar to rope through metal rings in that they can transfer energy from one place to another. In a circuit, electricity flows through wires like a current of water through a pipe. It can flow easily through metals, so the rings act as conductors and allow the energy to move quickly between them. Just as with ropes, if there is too much force on the circuit (if there is too much electricity flowing), it can break or sparks can fly.	electric circuit		Explain how electric circuit is similar to rope through metal rings.
Electricity is a flow of electrons through a conductor, like metal. When you connect the ends of a battery to two pieces of metal, electrons flow from the negative end of the battery to the positive end. This current will cause a magnetic field to form around the wires. If you have two pieces of metal connected by a piece of wire, and you move one piece closer to or further away from the other, the strength of this magnetic field will change and so will the current in the circuit. Just like when you pull on one side of a rope tied through two metal rings, it affects how tight or loose the knot is on either side	electric circuit		Explain how electric circuit is similar to rope through metal rings.
The hydrophobic effect is similar to teenagers at a party because they both try to avoid each other. The hydrophobic molecules try to stay away from the water molecules, and the teenagers try to stay away from adults.	hydrophobic effect		Explain how hydrophobic effect is similar to teenagers at a party.
The hydrophobic effect is similar to teenagers at a party in that they both tend to stick together. In the case of the hydrophobic effect, molecules that are not water-soluble tend to stick together due to their lack of attraction to water. This causes them to form clusters, which makes them less likely to dissolve in water.	hydrophobic effect		Explain how hydrophobic effect is similar to teenagers at a party.
Teens at a party are attracted to each other and tend to congregate in groups. Similarly, hydrophobic molecules are drawn to each other and form clusters.	hydrophobic effect		Explain how hydrophobic effect is similar to teenagers at a party.
At a party, the hydrophobic effect is similar to teenagers because they are both trying to avoid being near water. The hydrophobic effect is when substances try to stay away from water, and so they will move towards non-polar molecules instead. This is why oil and vinegar don't mix in a salad dressing - the oil doesn't want to be near the vinegar (which is full of water molecules).	hydrophobic effect		Explain how hydrophobic effect is similar to teenagers at a party.
When a group of teenagers are at a party, they tend to gather together in one area. This is because they are attracted to each other due to their shared interests and characteristics. The same thing happens with molecules that are hydrophobic. They are drawn together due to their similarities, which causes them to clump together.	hydrophobic effect		Explain how hydrophobic effect is similar to teenagers at a party.
In both cases, a signal is sent from one entity to another in order to elicit an action or response. In the case of biological signal transduction, this usually occurs between a cell and its environment, while in threat communication it happens between animals (or people). In both cases, there must be some form of communication channel that allows the sender to transmit the signal and the receiver to interpret it. Finally, in both cases the receiver's reaction depends on how well it can sense and respond to the signal.	biological signal transduction		Explain how biological signal transduction is similar to threat communication in animals.
Biological signal transduction is similar to threat communication in animals because both involve the transmission of a message from one entity to another.
