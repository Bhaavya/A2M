The human active memory system is analogous to a computer in that both systems store and manipulate information. The human memory system can be subdivided into three components: sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. Sensory memories are the fleeting impressions we get from our senses; for example, when you see someone you know across a room, your sensorymemory registers their appearance for a few seconds. Short-term memories are those memories that we actively think about or use regularly; for example, the phone number you just looked up is stored in your short-term memory. Long-term memories are those memories that we access infrequently but still remember; for example, your childhood home is probably stored in yourlong-term memory.

And the package is like a molecule that needs to be transported within the cell.	transport vesicles	Explain how transport vesicles is analogous to delivery truck.
A transport vesicle is a small, membranous sac that transports proteins and other molecules between different parts of a cell. This analogy would be like comparing a delivery truck to the human body. The delivery truck would be analogous to the transport vesicles, while the human body would be analogous to the cells within the body. The delivery truck would carry goods from one place to another, similar to how transport vesicles carry proteins and other molecules between different parts of a cell.	transport vesicles	Explain how transport vesicles is analogous to delivery truck.

Oncogenes are analogous to a car accelerator stuck in the down position. Just as an oncogene can cause cells to divide uncontrollably, a car accelerator stuck in the down position will cause the car to accelerate rapidly.	oncogenes	Explain how oncogenes is analogous to car accelerator stuck in down position.
Analogous to a car accelerator stuck in the down position, oncogenes are genes that can cause cells to grow and divide out of control. This can lead to the development of tumors.	oncogenes	Explain how oncogenes is analogous to car accelerator stuck in down position.
If a car's accelerator is stuck in the down position, it will continue to accelerate even if the driver takes their foot off of the pedal. Similarly, oncogenes are genes that can cause cancer cells to grow and divide uncontrollably, even if the cell is not stimulated by other growth factors.	oncogenes	Explain how oncogenes is analogous to car accelerator stuck in down position.
A car accelerator stuck in the down position is analogous to an oncogene that is constantly turned on.

Brittle software is analogous to jenga because both can be easily broken if too much pressure is applied. With brittle software, a small change in the codebase can cause a large number of errors. Similarly, with jenga, removing one block can cause the tower to collapse.	brittle software	Explain how brittle software is analogous to jenga.
Brittle software is like a game of jenga because it can be easily disrupted and fall apart. Just as one wrong move in jenga can cause the whole tower to come crashing down, one coding error or design flaw in brittle software can bring the entire system down.	brittle software	Explain how brittle software is analogous to jenga.
A game of Jenga typically consists of 54 wooden blocks. The aim of the game is to remove one block at a time from the tower, and then place it on top again, until the whole tower falls down. Brittle software is like this game because: - It can be easy to take something apart, but putting it back together can be difficult.-The slightest mistake can cause everything to come crashing down.	brittle software	Explain how brittle software is analogous to jenga.
Jenga is a game where players take turns removing blocks from a tower and placing them on the top. The goal is to remove as many blocks as possible without causing the tower to collapse. Brittle software is analogous to jenga because it is fragile and can easily break when impacted by changes or outside forces. Like the jenga tower, brittle software is composed of many individual pieces that are held together by relatively weak connections. If one piece of software breaks, it can cause the entire system to fail.	brittle software	Explain how brittle software is analogous to jenga.
Brittle software is analogous to jenga because they are both fragile. Jenga is a game that consists of wooden blocks in a rectangular tower. The objective of the game is to remove one block at a time and stack it on top of the other blocks without causing the tower to collapse. In order for the game to be successful, each block must be sturdy and well-connected to the others. If even one block is removed or disconnected from the rest of the tower, it can cause the entire structure to fall apart.In much the same way, brittle software is also fragile. If even one line of code is changed or deleted, it can cause errors or glitches in the program. Additionally, if there are any weak links in the coding, those could easily crumble under pressure which would result in an unstable application	brittle software	Explain how brittle software is analogous to jenga.
Rhino is a large mammal with a horn on its nose. It is similar to a hybrid of a horse and a cow. A resonance hybrid is an atom that has more than one possible electron configuration that it can form. The atom will "resonate" between the different configurations, just as the rhinoceros resonates between walking and running.	resonance hybrid	Explain how resonance hybrid is analogous to rhinoceros.
A resonance hybrid is a molecule that is composed of more than one Lewis structure. The atoms in the molecule are bonded together differently in each Lewis structure, but the bonding between the atoms is still consistent with the valence shell electron-pair rule. A rhinoceros is an animal that has two horns on its head. The horns are analogous to the Lewis structures in a resonance hybrid, because they are both made up of different parts that are bonded together consistently.	resonance hybrid	Explain how resonance hybrid is analogous to rhinoceros.
Rhinoceros is an animal that has a large horn on its nose. It is used for defense and also to help it move through thick brush. The word "rhinoceros" comes from the Greek words "ρινόκερος" meaning "nose horn". A resonance hybrid is an atom or molecule made up of two or more different types of atoms or molecules, held together by chemical bonds. The different atoms or molecules in a resonance hybrid are called resonating structures. Just like how the rhinoceros has a big horn on its nose, each resonating structure in a resonance hybrid contributes something to the overall molecule.	resonance hybrid	Explain how resonance hybrid is analogous to rhinoceros.
The word "rhinoceros" is made up of two words: "rhino" and "ceros". "Rhino" means nose, and "ceros" means horn. So, a rhinoceros is a creature that has a big nose and a big horn on its head.A resonance hybrid is also made up of two parts: the original molecule, called the parent compound, and a new molecule, called the daughter compound. The parent compound and the daughter compound are very similar to each other, but they're not exactly the same. Just like how there are different types of rhinoceroses (black rhinos and white rhinos), there are different types of resonance hybrids (meso-substituted benzene derivatives and meta-substituted benzene derivatives).	resonance hybrid	Explain how resonance hybrid is analogous to rhinoceros.
A rhinoceros is a large, herbivorous mammal with one or two horns on its snout. It is analogous to resonance hybrid because they are both large and have horns on their heads.	resonance hybrid	Explain how resonance hybrid is analogous to rhinoceros.
In both cases, energy is being emitted and travelling through the medium. In the case of fireflies, their light is emitting and travelling through the air. In the case of a wave mechanical model, sound waves are emitting and travelling through the air.	wave mechanical model	Explain how wave mechanical model is analogous to firefly in a dark room.
When you see a firefly in a dark room, you are seeing the light it emits. This light is created when the electricity in the firefly's cells causes atoms to give off photons. These photons spread out in all directions, and some of them bounce off objects and hit your eyes. The wave mechanical model of an atom is analogous to a firefly because it explains how atoms emit radiation. In both cases, radiation is emitted when charges move around.	wave mechanical model	Explain how wave mechanical model is analogous to firefly in a dark room.

The wave mechanical model is analogous to fireflies in a dark room because they are both based on the idea of emission and propagation of waves. In both cases, there is some initial source of energy that creates a wave or series of waves that spreads outwards.	wave mechanical model	Explain how wave mechanical model is analogous to firefly in a dark room.
In a dark room, when you see a firefly, you are seeing the light that it is emitting. The firefly is analogous to a wave mechanical model because the wave mechanical model emits light (energy) in order to be observed.	wave mechanical model	Explain how wave mechanical model is analogous to firefly in a dark room.
The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a measure of the electrical activity in the brain. This activity can be compared to listening to a game on the radio. Just as you can hear different sounds depending on where you are sitting in relation to the radio, EEG measures different types of brain activity depending on where it is recorded relative to the head.	electroencephalogram	Explain how electroencephalogram is analogous to listening to a game.
When you are listening to a game on the radio, the announcer's voice is coming through a speaker. The sound waves from the announcer's voice hit your ear and travel into your inner ear, where they cause tiny bones called ossicles to vibrate. These vibrations move fluid in three small tubes in your inner ear. This movement of fluid causes electrical signals to be sent to your brain. The electroencephalogram (EEG) works in a similar way. Electrodes placed on someone's scalp detect the voltage changes caused by the electrical activity of their brain cells.	electroencephalogram	Explain how electroencephalogram is analogous to listening to a game.

When you listen to a game on the radio, you are listening to the electrical signals that are being sent from the stadium to the radio station. The same thing happens when someone is taking an EEG. They are sending electrical signals from their brain to a machine that records them.	electroencephalogram	Explain how electroencephalogram is analogous to listening to a game.
When you listen to a game on the radio, what you are actually doing is listening to the electrical signals that are being sent from the stadium to the radio station. The same thing happens when you get an electroencephalogram (EEG). You are essentially listening to the electrical signals that are being sent from your brain to the machine.	electroencephalogram	Explain how electroencephalogram is analogous to listening to a game.
DNA replication is analogous to a photocopier machine because they are both copying mechanisms. The photocopier copies an image by projecting light onto the document and then reproducing the image using a chemical reaction. DNA replicates by projecting light (from enzymes) onto the double helix and then duplicating the strands using nucleotides.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is analogous to photocopier machine.
A photocopier machine copies an image by projecting light onto a surface and then using a chemical process to create a duplicate of the image. DNA replication works in a very similar way, with light being used to project the genetic information from one strand of DNA onto another. This duplication process is repeated over and over again until the cell divides, resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is analogous to photocopier machine.
DNA replication is analogous to photocopier machine because they both use the same principle of making a copy of something. In DNA replication, the double helix is unwound and each strand serves as a template for synthesis of a new complementary strand. This process is repeated until two identical chromosomes are formed.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is analogous to photocopier machine.
DNA replication is analogous to a photocopier machine because they are both processes that make copies of information. The photocopier machine uses light to create an image of the document and then creates copies of that image using ink. DNA replication also uses light (or radiation) to create an image of the original DNA molecule, and then creates copies of that molecule using nucleotides.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is analogous to photocopier machine.

Replication is analogous to book printing because it is a process of copying information. In replication, the DNA molecule is copied to produce two identical daughter molecules. This is similar to how a printer produces multiple copies of a document.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is analogous to book printing.
 DNA replication is analogous to book printing in that they are both processes of copying information. With DNA replication, the information is encoded within the sequence of nucleotides. With book printing, the information is encoded within the sequence of letters. In both cases, a copy of the original information is created.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is analogous to book printing.
Dna replication is analogous to book printing because they are both processes that copy information. In dna replication, the information is encoded in the sequence of base pairs in the dna molecule. In book printing, the information is encoded in the arrangement of letters on a page. Both processes use a copying mechanism to produce an exact replica of the original.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is analogous to book printing.
 DNA replication is analogous to book printing in that both processes involve the duplication of information. In book printing, a copy of each page is made so that there are two copies of the text.

In both cases, new copies can be made by following the set of instructions.	dna replication	Explain how dna replication is analogous to book printing.
Rna transcription is analogous to language translation in that they are both processes by which information is conveyed from one form to another. In the case of rna transcription, genetic information is encoded in dna and transferred to rna, while in the case of language translation, a text is written in one language and converted into another.	rna transcription	Explain how rna transcription is analogous to language translation.
RNA transcription can be thought of as analogous to language translation in that they are both processes by which a message is conveyed from one entity to another. In the case of RNA transcription, the genetic code within DNA is "transcribed" into messenger RNA (mRNA), which then directs the synthesis of proteins. In analogy, language translation takes a text written in one language and translates it into another language.	rna transcription	Explain how rna transcription is analogous to language translation.
In both RNA transcription and language translation, a set of instructions is converted into a new form. In transcription, the instructions are encoded in DNA; in translation, they are encoded in a sequence of codons. In both processes, there is a step-by-step conversion from one format to another, with each step relying on information from the previous step.	rna transcription	Explain how rna transcription is analogous to language translation.
In both processes, a message is converted from one form to another. In transcription, rna is created based on the sequence of dna codons. In translation, mrna is read and used to create proteins based on the sequence of amino acids.	rna transcription	Explain how rna transcription is analogous to language translation.
Rna transcription is analogous to language translation in that they are both processes by which information is conveyed from one entity to another. In the case of rna transcription, genetic information is conveyed from DNA to RNA; in the case of language translation, written or spoken words are conveyed from one language into another.	rna transcription	Explain how rna transcription is analogous to language translation.
Protein translation is analogous to language translation in that both processes require a set of instructions (the genetic code) and a means of carrying out those instructions (the ribosome). In addition, the end result of both processes is the creation of a new entity (a protein or translated sentence, respectively).	protein translation	Explain how protein translation is analogous to language translation.
Protein translation is analogous to language translation in that they are both processes of converting a coded sequence into an understandable product. In protein translation, the coded sequence is the genetic code, and the product is a protein molecule. In language translation, the coded sequence is a sentence in one language, and the product is a translated sentence in another language.	protein translation	Explain how protein translation is analogous to language translation.
Protein translation and language translation are both processes that involve the transmission of information from one entity to another. In protein translation, this information is conveyed in the form of a genetic code, which is translated into a sequence of amino acids that make up a protein. In language translation, this information is conveyed in the form of words and sentences, which are translated into another language. Both processes require an understanding of the code or language being used, as well as a knowledge of the target language or protein structure.	protein translation	Explain how protein translation is analogous to language translation.
Protein translation is analogous to language translation in that they are both processes by which a message is conveyed from one form to another. In protein translation, the coded sequence of nucleotides in DNA is converted into a corresponding sequence of amino acids in proteins.

In both cases, there is a translator who interprets the instructions and produces a new product based on them.	protein translation	Explain how protein translation is analogous to language translation.
An ecosystem is analogous to a city in the way that it is composed of many different parts that interact with each other. The difference is that an ecosystem is composed of plants, animals, and microorganisms, while a city is composed of humans and their built environment.	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is analogous to cities.
Both ecosystem and cities are composed of many different parts that interact with each other. The parts in an ecosystem include the plants, animals, and microorganisms, while the parts in a city include the humans, buildings, roads, and parks. Ecosystems can be thought of as small cities, and cities can be thought of as large ecosystems.	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is analogous to cities.
An ecosystem is analogous to a city in that it is an organized system of interconnected parts. The parts of an ecosystem are the plants, animals, and microorganisms that interact with each other and their environment. Just as in a city, the inhabitants of an ecosystem depend on each other for survival.	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is analogous to cities.
A city is a human-made environment, where people live and work. The city has infrastructure, such as roads and buildings, which allow for the movement of people and goods. It also has services, like water and waste management, which allow residents to live in the city. Cities are supported by natural resources, like fertile land for agriculture or minerals for manufacturing.An ecosystem is also a human-made environment, where plants and animals live and interact with each other. The ecosystem has infrastructure, like rivers and forests, which allow for the movement of plants and animals. It also has services, like pollination or seed dispersal, which allow plants and animals to survive in the ecosystem. Ecosystems are supported by natural resources, like fresh air or clean water	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is analogous to cities.
The two are analogous because they are both systems in which different parts work together to create a functioning whole. In an ecosystem, different species of plants and animals interact with each other and their environment to create a balanced system in which all the members thrive. Similarly, in a city, people from different walks of life live together and interact with each other to create a thriving community.	ecosystem	Explain how ecosystem is analogous to cities.
The propagation of an action potential down a neuron is analogous to falling dominoes because it is a sequential process that occurs in a specific order.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is analogous to falling dominoes.
The analogy between the propagation of an action potential down a neuron and falling dominoes is as follows: The stimulus (the first domino) starts the process by knocking over the adjacent one. This causes it to knock over the next one, and so on, until the last one is knocked over and completes the circuit. In a similar way, an initial action potential will start a chain reaction of depolarization that travels down the neuron.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is analogous to falling dominoes.
When one domino falls, it knocks over the next one. This process is repeated until all of the dominoes have fallen. An action potential travels down a neuron in a similar way. When an action potential arrives at a synapse, it causes the release of neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters travel across the synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell. This triggers an electrical response in the postsynaptic cell that spreads along its membrane and eventually results in an action potential.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is analogous to falling dominoes.
When the first domino falls, it knocks over the next domino. This second domino then knocks over the next one, and so on. The propagation of an action potential down a neuron is similar because when the first ion channel opens, it allows positively charged ions to flow into the cell. This causes the voltage inside the cell to increase, which in turn causes more ion channels to open. This process continues until all of the ion channels have opened and caused an action potential to fire.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is analogous to falling dominoes.
When the first domino falls, it knocks over the second domino. This second domino then knocks over the third, and so on. The propagation of an action potential down a neuron is very similar: when the first voltage-gated sodium ion channel opens, it allows Na+ ions to flow into the neuron. This influx of Na+ ions then causes more voltage-gated sodium ion channels to open, which allows even more Na+ ions to enter the neuron. This process continues until all of the voltage-gated sodium ion channels are open and the action potential has been propagated down the neuron.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Explain how propagation of an action potential down a neuron is analogous to falling dominoes.
When you blow up a balloon, the air inside the balloon gets forced out. When you breathe in, your lungs fill with oxygen-rich air. This causes a decrease in pressure on the outside of your lungs. Since the pressure inside the balloon is greater than the pressure outside, the air rushes into and inflates the balloon	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is analogous to blowing of the balloon.
The breathing mechanism of frogs is analogous to blowing of the balloon. When you blow into a balloon, it inflates because the air pressure inside the balloon is greater than the atmospheric pressure outside. The same thing happens when you breathe in: your lungs inflate because the air pressure inside your lungs is greater than the atmospheric pressure outside.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is analogous to blowing of the balloon.
The frog's breathing mechanism is analogous to the blowing of a balloon. When you blow into a balloon, the air inside the balloon is forced out and the balloon gets smaller. When the frog inhales, it forces air into its lungs and its chest cavity gets bigger. When it exhales, it forces the air out of its lungs and its chest cavity gets smaller again	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is analogous to blowing of the balloon.
When you blow up a balloon, the air pressure inside the balloon increases. This increase in pressure pushes against the walls of the balloon, causing it to inflate. The same thing happens when you breathe in: your lungs increase the pressure of the air inside them, which causes your chest and abdomen to expand.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is analogous to blowing of the balloon.
When you blow up a balloon, the air pressure inside the balloon increases. This increase in pressure makes it harder for the molecules of gas inside the balloon to escape. The same thing happens when you breathe in - the air pressure inside your lungs increases, making it harder for the oxygen molecules to escape.	breathing mechanism of frogs	Explain how breathing mechanism of frogs is analogous to blowing of the balloon.
In a communication system with translators, messages are sent from one person to another in a series of steps. The first person sends a message to the translator, who then translates it into the second language. The translated message is then sent back to the translator, who forwards it to the second person. This process repeats until the message reaches its final destination.In layered architecture, messages are also sent through a series of steps. The first layer receives messages from applications and passes them on to the next layer. The next layer processes the messages and passes them on to the next layer or returns them to an earlier layer if necessary. This process continues until the messages reach their final destination.	layered architecture	Explain how layered architecture is analogous to communication with translators.
Just as a translator facilitates communication between two people who speak different languages, a layer in a layered architecture allows different parts of the system to communicate. The translator takes the form of an intermediary that understands both languages and can relay messages accurately from one person to another. Similarly, each layer in a layered architecture serves as an intermediary that enables different parts of the system to talk to each other.	layered architecture	Explain how layered architecture is analogous to communication with translators.
Layered architecture is analogous to communication with translators in that it allows different parts of the system to communicate with each other without having to understand the entire system. By providing a layer of translation between different components, layered architecture allows for more modularity and flexibility in the system. This can be useful for allowing different teams to work on different parts of the system without interfering with each other, as well as for accommodating changes in the system over time.	layered architecture	Explain how layered architecture is analogous to communication with translators.
Layered architecture is analogous to communication with translators in that it provides a way for different parts of an organization to communicate without having to understand each other's language. In this analogy, the layers are like languages, and the translators are like intermediaries who can translate between them.	layered architecture	Explain how layered architecture is analogous to communication with translators.
Layered architecture is analogous to communication with translators in that they both involve a hierarchy of systems. In communication with translators, a message is sent from one system to another, and each system involved adds its own layer of meaning. This process continues until the message reaches its final destination, where it is decoded and understood. Layered architecture works in much the same way. A message is sent from one system to another, and each system involved adds its own layer of functionality. This process continues until the message reaches its final destination, where it is processed and used by the application.	layered architecture	Explain how layered architecture is analogous to communication with translators.
When there is a limited supply of a particular type of chocolate, for example dark chocolate, the amount that each person receives will be based on how much they need. If there is more dark chocolate than people, then those who want more will get more. If there is less dark chocolate than people, then those who want less will get less. In this analogy, the limited reactant would be the dark chocolate and the excess reactant would be the milk chocolate.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is analogous to chocolate distribution.
If there is a chocolate bar and two people, the limiting reactant would be the chocolate bar because it is limited in how much it can divide. The excess reactant would be one of the people because they are not limited in how much chocolate they can consume.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is analogous to chocolate distribution.
A limiting reactant is like a chocolate bar that is only partially eaten. There is only so much chocolate, and once it's gone, there's no more. An excess reactant is like a chocolate bar that has been mostly consumed. There is still plenty of chocolate left to eat.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is analogous to chocolate distribution.
A chocolate factory has a limited supply of chocolates that it can produce every day. The factory wants to make sure that it distributes the chocolates evenly among its customers, so it sets a limit on how many chocolates each customer can purchase. If a customer tries to buy more than the limit, the factory will not sell any additional chocolates to that customer. In a similar way, when two chemicals react in a chemical reaction, there is only a limited amount of each chemical available. If one of the chemicals runs out before the other one does, then the reaction stops because there are no more molecules of that chemical left to react. This is analogous to a customer at the chocolate factory who reaches their limit and can't buy anymore chocolates.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is analogous to chocolate distribution.
When there is a limited amount of a reactant, that reactant will be used up first. This leaves less of the reactant for the other reaction to occur, so the reaction will happen more slowly. When there is an excess of a reactant, that excess will be available to participate in the reaction. This means that the reaction will happen more quickly.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain how limiting reactant and excess reactant is analogous to chocolate distribution.
One way to think of a eukaryotic cell is as an office. Just like in an office, there are many different types of people working together to get things done. In a eukaryotic cell, these people include the nucleus, mitochondria, and ribosomes. The nucleus acts as the boss, organizing and coordinating all the other activities in the cell. The mitochondria are responsible for generating energy for the cell, much like power plants in an office. And finally, the ribosomes produce proteins that help keep everything running smoothly.	eukaryotic cell	Explain how eukaryotic cell is analogous to working office.
Eukaryotic cells are very much like an office, in that there is a hierarchical structure with specific jobs to be done. The nucleus is the boss, and it directs all of the other parts of the cell to do their work. Just as different people have different jobs in an office (accountants, secretaries, managers), different parts of the eukaryotic cell have specific tasks to carry out (ribosomes make proteins, organelles process food and oxygen). Finally, just as an office relies on communication between its employees to function effectively, so too does a eukaryotic cell rely on communication between its various parts.	eukaryotic cell	Explain how eukaryotic cell is analogous to working office.
In both eukaryotic cells and offices, workers are organized into specialized groups to carry out specific tasks. In a cell, these groups include the nucleus, mitochondria, and ribosomes. Each group has a specific role in the functioning of the cell. Similarly, in an office, different employees have specialized roles such as accounting, marketing, or human resources.	eukaryotic cell	Explain how eukaryotic cell is analogous to working office.
Like a working office, a eukaryotic cell has many different parts that work together to achieve a common goal. The nucleus houses the cells genetic material, much like the boss in an office oversees all the workers. The cytoplasm is filled with organelles that carry out specific tasks, similar to the various departments in an office. And finally, the cell membrane acts as the boundary between inside and outside of the cell, just like walls separate different areas of an office.	eukaryotic cell	Explain how eukaryotic cell is analogous to working office.
A eukaryotic cell is analogous to a working office in that both have many parts that work together to achieve a common goal. The nucleus is like the boss, giving orders to the rest of the cell.

A roller coaster is made up of a series of hills and valleys (analogous to glycolysis), which riders travel down (analogous to the glucose molecule traveling through glycolysis). The height of each hill and valley corresponds to the energy level of that particular part of the ride (the higher the energy, the bigger the hill or valley). At the beginning and end of the ride, there are low-energy areas where riders coast along without much excitement. These correspond to the two stages of glycolysis where no ATP is produced. In between, there are high-energy areas where riders experience lots of thrills and excitement as they speed around curves and down slopes. These correspond to the two stages of glycolysis where ATP is produced.	glycolysis	Explain how glycolysis is analogous to roller coaster.
The analogy between glycolysis and a roller coaster is that they are both processes that involve energy transfer. In the case of glycolysis, the energy comes from glucose molecules, while in the case of a roller coaster it comes from gravity. The energy is transferred to kinetic energy as it moves down the track or through the bloodstream.	glycolysis	Explain how glycolysis is analogous to roller coaster.
When a ball is striking a plate, the ball and plate will interact with each other. This interaction will cause some of the energy from the ball to be transferred to the plate, and some of the energy from the plate to be transferred back to the ball. This transfer of energy will cause both the ball and plate to move in opposite directions after impact.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
When a ball is struck against a plate, the kinetic energy of the ball is transferred to the plate. This causes the plate to vibrate and create sound waves. The anti-stokes scattering process is similar in that it involves the transfer of kinetic energy from one particle to another. In this case, however, the particles are molecules and the energy is transferred through collisions between them.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
The anti-stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate in the following ways:1. In both cases, there is an initial impact that creates waves of energy that propagate away from the point of impact.2. The waves created by each event will eventually dissipate as they lose energy to the surrounding environment.3. The rate at which the waves dissipate depends on how much resistance they encounter along their path.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
When a ball is struck against a plate, the ball rebounds in the opposite direction. This occurs because as the ball collides with the plate, it pushes molecules of air away from itself. These displaced air molecules collide with other nearby air molecules and create a wave of pressure that travels in the opposite direction of the original collision. This wave causes the ball to rebound in the opposite direction.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
When a ball is struck by a bat, the energy in the ball is transferred to the bat. This energy causes the atoms in the bat to vibrate. The vibration of these atoms creates sound waves that travel away from the bat. These sound waves are analogous to anti-stokes scattering. In both cases, energy is transferred from one object to another and creates vibrations or sound waves.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain how anti-stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
When a ball is thrown at a plate, the ball interacts with the atoms in the plate. The atoms cause the ball to scatter in all directions. This is similar to stokes scattering where light interacts with particles and scatters in all directions.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
When a ball is hit against a plate, the kinetic energy of the ball is transferred to the plate. The same happens with light when it hits an object- the kinetic energy of the light is transferred to the object.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
In both cases, a force is exerted on an object which causes it to move. For stokes scattering, the photons are hitting the dust particle and causing it to move. For ball striking a plate, the ball is hitting the plate and causing it to move.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
Stokes scattering is similar to ball striking a plate in that both result in the transfer of energy. When a ball strikes a plate, it transfers its energy to the plate, causing it to vibrate. The same thing happens when light interacts with matter. The light transfers its energy to the atoms, causing them to vibrate.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
When a ball is thrown at a plate, it bounces off. This happens because the ball has momentum and when it hits the plate, some of that momentum is transferred to the plate. The same thing happens with light. When light hits something, some of its momentum is transferred to the object it hit.	stokes scattering	Explain how stokes scattering is analogous to ball striking a plate.
The median lethal dose (LD50) is a measure of the potency of a substance as a poison. It indicates the amount of a substance required to kill half the members of a tested population within a specified time frame. The analogy between this and balls and target is that it can be viewed as the point at which 50% of the "targets" are hit.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is analogous to balls and target.
The analogy between the median lethal dose and balls and target is that they are both used to measure something. The median lethal dose is used to measure how much of a substance it takes to kill 50% of a population, while balls and target are used to measure accuracy.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is analogous to balls and target.
In the analogy, the target is analogous to a person's tolerance for a drug. The balls are analogous to the amount of the drug in question. The larger the ball, the more potent (lethal) it is.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is analogous to balls and target.
If you think of the balls as representing dose (in milligrams), and the target as representing a lethal dose (also in milligrams), then hitting the target would be equivalent to achieving the median lethal dose. In other words, if you gave a group of animals a range of doses, 50% of them would die when given the dose that corresponds to the center of the target, or median lethal dose.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is analogous to balls and target.
Assuming you have a large container filled with either red or blue balls, if you want to find the median lethal dose (LD 50 ) of some substance, you could randomly select balls from the container and test how poisonous they are. The LD 50 would be the dose that kills half of the test subjects. It's analogous to finding the center of a target: it's the dose that hits most people in the middle.	median lethal dose	Explain how median lethal dose is analogous to balls and target.
The universe is analogous to the surface of a balloon because it is expanding. The surface of a balloon expands when you blow air into it. The universe expands when new matter is created.	universe	Explain how universe is analogous to surface of a balloon.
The universe is analogous to the surface of a balloon in that it is constantly expanding. Just as the surface of a balloon expands when you blow into it, so too does the universe expand as new matter is created.	universe	Explain how universe is analogous to surface of a balloon.
The surface of a balloon is analogous to the universe in that they are both two-dimensional objects with an infinite number of points.	universe	Explain how universe is analogous to surface of a balloon.
The universe is analogous to the surface of a balloon in that it is constantly expanding. Just as the surface of a balloon expands when you blow air into it, the universe expands as more and more matter is created.	universe	Explain how universe is analogous to surface of a balloon.
A balloon is inflated and the air inside pushes outwards against the rubber of the balloon. The surface of the balloon then becomes curved. Similarly, the universe is expanding and pushing outwards against the fabric of space-time. This causes space-time to curve, just like the surface of a balloon.	universe	Explain how universe is analogous to surface of a balloon.
The lock and key analogy is used to describe the specificity of enzymes. Enzymes are proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions. The specificity of an enzyme is determined by its shape. The shape of the enzyme is like a key and the substrate (the molecule it acts on) is like the lock. Only certain molecules can fit into the specific shape of the enzyme and thus, only those substrates will be catalyzed by that enzyme.	enzyme mechanism	Explain how enzyme mechanism is analogous to lock and key.
The enzyme mechanism is analogous to the lock and key in that the enzyme is the lock and the substrate is the key. The enzyme recognizes only a specific substrate molecule and then binds to it, much like how a particular key will fit into a certain lock. Once bound, the enzyme catalyzes a reaction between the two molecules, just as how turning the key will activate the lock.	enzyme mechanism	Explain how enzyme mechanism is analogous to lock and key.
Just as a key can only fit into a certain lock, an enzyme's active site is specific for a certain molecule. The substrate (molecule the enzyme acts on) binds to the active site and the enzyme catalyzes (speeds up) the reaction.	enzyme mechanism	Explain how enzyme mechanism is analogous to lock and key.
The enzyme mechanism is analogous to lock and key in that the enzyme is the lock and the substrate is the key. The substrate fits into the active site of the enzyme like a key fits into a lock, and when it does, the two molecules collide and interaction occurs. This interaction causes a change in the shape of the enzyme, which then allows for catalysis to take place.	enzyme mechanism	Explain how enzyme mechanism is analogous to lock and key.
The lock and key analogy is a metaphor that explains how enzymes work. The lock is the enzyme, and the key is the substrate. The substrate fits into the active site of the enzyme like a key in a lock, and this interaction allows the enzyme to catalyze the reaction.	enzyme mechanism	Explain how enzyme mechanism is analogous to lock and key.
The purpose of an ANOVA is to determine whether the variation among groups (factors) is statistically significant. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the groups, and the alternative hypothesis is that there are differences. In other words, does variability within a group (the noise) differ from one group to another? This test takes into account the amount of variation in each group by calculating an F statistic. Analogously, when we are trying to find a signal amongst noise, we want to know if the variance of our data is coming from some underlying process or if it's just due to random fluctuations (noise). We can do this by performing an ANOVA and calculating an F statistic. If the F statistic is large enough, then we can say that there's a statistically significant difference between the groups and that the variance isn't simply due to chance fluctuations.	anova	Explain how anova is analogous to finding signal in the noise.
How anova is analogous to finding signal in the noise:One way to think about how anova works is by analogy with the process of finding a signal in noisy data. In both cases, there is some underlying structure that we are trying to tease out from a mess of information. The goal is to find the most important patterns amid all the variability so that we can make sense of what is going on.	anova	Explain how anova is analogous to finding signal in the noise.
Both anova and finding signal in the noise involve identifying patterns in data. Anova is used to identify differences between groups of data, while finding signal in the noise is used to identify patterns in noisy data.	anova	Explain how anova is analogous to finding signal in the noise.
In the context of anova, noise is variability in the data that is not due to treatment effects. Signal is the variation in the data that is due to treatment effects. By using anova, we can detect and isolate signal from noise so that we can better understand the effect of treatments on our data.	anova	Explain how anova is analogous to finding signal in the noise.
A way to find signal in noise is through the use of anova, which is a statistical technique used to compare the means of two or more groups. This technique can be used to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the means of the groups being compared. By using anova, one can locate and identify differences that may have been obscured by variability within groups.	anova	Explain how anova is analogous to finding signal in the noise.
A thermostat is a device that controls the temperature of a room by regulating the amount of heat that is emitted from a heating unit. The hypothalamus is a small, oval-shaped organ located in the brain that regulates many bodily functions, including body temperature.	thermostat	Explain how thermostat is analogous to hypothalamus.
A thermostat is a device used to control the temperature of an environment. It senses the temperature of the environment and then either heats or cools the environment in order to maintain the desired temperature. The hypothalamus is a part of the brain that controls many body functions, including body temperature.

It does this by turning on or off an electric heating or cooling element as necessary in order to maintain the desired temperature. The hypothalamus is a small region of the brain that regulates many bodily functions, including body temperature.	thermostat	Explain how thermostat is analogous to hypothalamus.
The hypothalamus is responsible for maintaining homeostasis in the body and controls things such as hunger, thirst, body temperature, and hormone production. A thermostat also maintains homeostasis by regulating the environment's temperature.	thermostat	Explain how thermostat is analogous to hypothalamus.
In a dam, the water level is analogous to the chemical equilibrium. The height of the water in the reservoir (lake) is determined by how much water flows into it from upstream and how much leaks or evaporates away. In the same way, concentrations of chemicals in a solution are determined by how much material enters and leaves the solution.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is analogous to water level in dam and lake.
In a dam, the water level is analogous to chemical equilibrium because just as the water level must be maintained in order for the dam to function, so must the chemical equilibrium be maintained in order for a reaction to occur. The lake is analogous to the system being studied (e.g., a reactor or laboratory experiment), and its height is analogous to the concentration of reactants and products in that system.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is analogous to water level in dam and lake.
If a dam is holding back water, the water level in the lake will be at its highest point when the dam is at equilibrium. If the amount of water flowing into the lake is greater than the amount flowing out, then the water level in the lake will rise. If more water flows out of the lake than flows in, then	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is analogous to water level in dam and lake.
When water is released from a dam, the water level in the lake below it decreases. The same thing happens when a chemical reaction reaches equilibrium - the concentration of reactants and products in the solution is equal, so no more net change occurs.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is analogous to water level in dam and lake.
The water level in a dam is analogous to chemical equilibrium because, like the water in a dam, the concentration of chemicals in a solution will reach a balance and stay constant. The water level in a lake is also analogous to chemical equilibrium because, like the chemicals in a solution, the concentrations of different substances in a lake will reach a balance and stay constant.	chemical equilibrium	Explain how chemical equilibrium is analogous to water level in dam and lake.

Just-in-time works like water by constantly moving and flowing, while just-in-time manufacturing relies on the constant delivery of parts so that products can be assembled as they are needed. Just-in-time is also like rocks because it provides a solid foundation that helps keep everything else in place.	just-in-time	Explain how just-in-time is analogous to water and rocks.
Adaptive immunity can be thought of as analogous to police headquarters. The adaptive immune system is responsible for monitoring the body for potential threats, and then mounting a response if necessary. This analogy can be further extended to consider the different types of cells in each system: Police officers are responsible for patrolling the streets and investigating crimes, while detectives are responsible for gathering information and solving crimes. Similarly, white blood cells are responsible for attacking invading organisms, while T-cells help to identify specific threats that require a response.	adaptive immunity	Explain how adaptive immunity is analogous to police headquerters.
Adaptive immunity is analogous to police headquarters because it is the central location where all of the information about potential threats is collected and analyzed.

Adaptive immunity is analogous to police headquarters because they are both responsible for coordinating and directing the activity of different parts of the system. The immune system has many different cells and organs that need to work together in order to protect the body from infection, and adaptive immunity is responsible for organizing and directing their activity. Police headquarters is responsible for coordinating the activities of different police departments in a city, ensuring that everyone is working together towards a common goal. Similarly, adaptive immunity coordinates the activities of different cells and organs in the immune system, ensuring that they are all working together to protect us from infection.	adaptive immunity	Explain how adaptive immunity is analogous to police headquerters.
Adaptive immunity can be thought of as analogous to police headquarters, in that it is the central location where all information about potential threats and the corresponding responses are collected and analyzed. From here, decisions can be made about what actions need to be taken in order to protect the population from harm.	adaptive immunity	Explain how adaptive immunity is analogous to police headquerters.
Adaptive immunity is analogous to police headquarters in that it coordinates and oversees the immune response. It receives information from different parts of the body about potential threats, and then decides which actions to take in order to protect the body.

Ohm's law is analogous to cats, mice and cake because they are all related to electricity. Ohm's law states that the current through a resistor is proportional to the voltage across the resistor. This is analogous to how a cat will always be attracted to mice, as the voltage (or potential energy) between them will be highest where they are closest together. The same analogy can be made with cake - the closer two people are, the more delicious their conversation will be!	ohm's law	Explain how ohm's law is analogous to cats, mice and cake.
The law of ohms is analogous to cats, mice and cake in that it is a fundamental principle that governs how electricity flows. Just as different types of animals have different characteristics, so too do electrical circuits have different properties depending on the resistance of the components within them. And just as cakes come in all shapes and sizes, there are myriad ways to configure an electrical circuit. But at its heart, the flow of electricity through a circuit follows Ohm's Law.	ohm's law	Explain how ohm's law is analogous to cats, mice and cake.
Cats, mice and cake are all analogous because they are each living creatures that can be measured in terms of their voltage, current and resistance.

The law is analogous to cats, mice and cake because it states that in order for something to work (like a light bulb), there must be a flow of electricity. Just as you need one or more cats to keep the mouse population under control, you need an electric current (flow of electrons) to make things work. And just as you might enjoy eating cake on your birthday, electron flow through wires creates electrical energy that powers our devices and appliances.	ohm's law	Explain how ohm's law is analogous to cats, mice and cake.

Activator proteins are analogous to bookmarks in that they are both used to help locate a particular section of DNA. Activator proteins bind to specific sequences of DNA and act as signals that tell the cell's machinery which genes should be turned on or off.

Electricity is analogous to air flowing through a tube. Just as the speed of the air flow depends on the diameter of the tube, so does the electric current depend on the cross-sectional area of the conductor. And just as narrowing down the diameter of a tube increases resistance to airflow, likewise increasing resistance in an electrical circuit reduces current flow.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is analogous to air flowing through a tube.
Electricity is a flow of electrons through a conductor, like water flowing through a pipe. In the same way that pushing on one end of a rope makes it move all the way to the other end, pushing on one electron in an electric circuit makes all the other electrons move too.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is analogous to rope through metal rings.
Electric current is analogous to the rope, while voltage is analogous to the metal rings. Just as the rope can easily slide through the metal rings if there is little resistance, a low voltage will allow an electric current to flow easily through a circuit. However, if you increase the voltage by placing more metal rings closer together, it becomes harder for the rope to pass through them and less current will flow.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is analogous to rope through metal rings.
Electric current can be thought of as a flow of electrons through a metal wire. Just as pulling on one end of a rope makes it taut and pulls the other end, applying an electric current to one end of a wire will make it taut and pull electrons from the opposite end. In this analogy, the metal rings are like atoms in a metal wire, and the rope is like the electron flow.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is analogous to rope through metal rings.

Just as you can increase or decrease the flow rate of water by changing the width of the opening at different points in the system, you can control electric current by controlling voltage and resistance. You can also create turbulence in an electric circuit (just as in a plumbing system) by adding inductors or capacitors.	electric circuit	Explain how electric circuit is analogous to rope through metal rings.
The hydrophobic effect is analogous to teenagers at a party in that both phenomena involve groups of people who are interacting with each other. The teenagers are attracted to each other and congregate together, while the water molecules are drawn to each other and form clusters.	hydrophobic effect	Explain how hydrophobic effect is analogous to teenagers at a party.
When teenagers get together at a party, they tend to group together in one area. This is because they are attracted to each other due to their shared interests (in this analogy, the hydrophobic effect). They also tend to avoid being near groups of people that they don't know or don't have anything in common with (analogy: water droplets repelling each other).	hydrophobic effect	Explain how hydrophobic effect is analogous to teenagers at a party.
The hydrophobic effect is analogous to teenagers at a party in that they are both trying to avoid each other. The hydrophobic molecules are trying to get away from the water, and the water is trying to keep them together.	hydrophobic effect	Explain how hydrophobic effect is analogous to teenagers at a party.
The hydrophobic effect is analogous to teenagers at a party in that they both tend to move away from each other. In the case of the teens, this is because they are social animals and want to be around others like themselves. Similarly, molecules interact with each other through electrostatic forces, and these interactions are stronger when the molecules are closer together. This means that the hydrophobic (water-hating) molecules will try to move away from the water so that they can be closer to their fellow hydrophobic molecules.	hydrophobic effect	Explain how hydrophobic effect is analogous to teenagers at a party.
Just as the hydrophobic effect pushes water molecules away from other molecules, teenagers at a party push each other away to create their own space.	hydrophobic effect	Explain how hydrophobic effect is analogous to teenagers at a party.
Biological signal transduction is analogous to threat communication in animals because they are both ways that information is conveyed between two or more individuals. In biological signal transduction, the information being conveyed is a chemical message that results in a change in the behavior of the recipient. In threat communication, the information being conveyed is a warning signal that causes the recipient to take action to avoid danger.	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is analogous to threat communication in animals.
Biological signal transduction is similar to threat communication in animals because it is a way for organisms to send messages to each other that can result in an action. In both cases, there is a sender and a receiver, and the sender is trying to get the receiver to do something.	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is analogous to threat communication in animals.
Biological signal transduction can be seen as analogous to threat communication in animals because it is a process by which information is transmitted between cells or tissues. In both cases, there is a sender and a receiver, and the transmission of information results in some type of response.	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is analogous to threat communication in animals.
Biological signal transduction can be thought of as a type of threat communication. For example, when an animal senses danger, it may produce a hormone such as adrenaline that triggers the body to take defensive action. Similarly, when cells in the body receive a signal (e.g., from a hormone or neurotransmitter), they produces molecules called second messengers that relay the message throughout the cell.	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is analogous to threat communication in animals.
The way that a signal is transduced from one molecule to another across a cell membrane is analogous to the way that animals use communication to warn each other of danger. In both cases, there is a sender (the animal issuing the warning) and a receiver (the animal perceiving the warning). The sender produces a signal (a loud noise or an alarm call) that travels through the environment to the receiver. The receiver then interprets the signal and produces an appropriate response (running away or hiding).	biological signal transduction	Explain how biological signal transduction is analogous to threat communication in animals.
