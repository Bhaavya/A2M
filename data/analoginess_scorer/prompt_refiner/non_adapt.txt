A hacker might be able to gain access to the SCADA system and change the data that is collected, or even take control of the process. This can cause serious safety and financial problems for the company that operates the SCADA system.Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting these systems from cyber attacks. This includes measures such as firewalls, password protection, and intrusion detection systems.
Cybersecurity can be thought of as the “firewall” for a SCADA system. A firewall is a piece of software or hardware that is used to protect a computer or network from attacks. It does this by blocking access to certain websites or applications, and by preventing unauthorized users from accessing the system. Cybersecurity works in a similar way, by blocking access to certain parts of the SCADA system, and by preventing unauthorized users from gaining access to it.	supervisory control and data acquisition	Using an analogy, explain supervisory control and data acquisition (cybersecurity).	ht	cybersecurity	1	Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) is a system that collects data from various sensors in an industrial or manufacturing process, and then uses that data to control the process.

It does this by creating "what-if" scenarios in which the data is manipulated to create a more equal playing field. This allows the system to be tested for bias and ensures that it produces equitable results.

You could do this by randomly grabbing pieces of candy from the bag and counting up how many times each type pops up. This would give you an idea of what the chances are for each type of candy. This is basically what the softmax function does. It takes a vector of real values (in our analogy, this would be the count for each type of candy) and turns it into a vector of probabilities (the chances for each type of candy).	full softmax	Explain full softmax (machine learning) using an analogy.	ht	machine learning	1	A softmax function is a way to turn a vector of real values into a vector of probabilities. It works by taking a vector of real values and squashing them down into a vector of probabilities between 0 and 1. This is done by multiplying each value in the vector by a weight and then adding all of the weighted values up. The resulting vector is then normalized so that the sum of all the probabilities is 1.

Assume you are a contestant on a game show. There are four doors in front of you, and behind one of the doors is a prize worth $1,000. Behind the other three doors are nothing. You can choose any door to open, but once you have chosen a door, it is closed and no longer an option. Now imagine that there are ten contestants playing the game show. Each contestant has their own unique odds of winning the prize: 1 in 10, 1 in 100, 1 in 1,000 and so on. If we wanted to find out the probability that any particular contestant would win the prize, we could use something called a softmax function.The softmax function takes as input an array of numbers (representing each contestant's odds of winning) and outputs a single number between 0 and 1 (representing the probability that any particular contestant will win). So for our example above, if we ran the softmax function on our array of numbers [1/10; 1/100; 1/1000; ...], it would output 0.098 - meaning there is a 98% chance that any given contestant will not win the prize money!	full softmax	Explain full softmax (machine learning) using an analogy.	ht	machine learning	1	A softmax function is a way to turn a vector of real values into a vector of probabilities.

 imagine you are a contestant on a game show. There are ten possible answers to each question, and you want to choose the one that is most likely to be correct. You can think of each answer as a vector (1-10), with the probability of choosing that answer being inversely proportional to its distance from 1 (so an answer that is 2 away from 1 would have a probability of .5, while an answer that is 5 away from 1 would have a probability of .1). The softmax function takes these vectors and turns them into probabilities by squashing them down into numbers between 0 and 1. This is done by multiplying each value in the vector by a weight and then adding all of the weighted values up. The resulting vector will be normalized so that the sum of all the probabilities is 1.	full softmax	Explain full softmax (machine learning) using an analogy.	ht	machine learning	1	A softmax function is a way to turn a vector of real values into a vector of probabilities.

An analogy for the softmax function is a group of people all trying to guess a number. The person who guesses the number correctly wins, and everyone else gets a consolation prize. In this analogy, the guessing game is like training a machine learning model. The person who guesses the number correctly is like the final activation value of the model, and everyone else getting a consolation prize is like the other values in the vector being normalized.	full softmax	Explain full softmax (machine learning) using an analogy.	ht	machine learning	1	A softmax function is a way to turn a vector of real values into a vector of probabilities.

Gradient clipping is a technique used in machine learning to prevent a neural network from overfitting the training data. It works by clipping the gradient of the neural network at a certain value. This prevents the neural network from learning the details of the training data and instead allows it to learn the general trend.An analogy for gradient clipping would be if you were trying to learn how to ride a bike, and you only rode around your neighborhood. You would not be able to learn how to ride a bike properly because you would not be able to experience different terrains and obstacles. However, if you clip your bike's brakes so that it could only go so fast, then you would be able to learn how to ride a bike without having too much control over where you went.	gradient clipping	Explain gradient clipping (machine learning) using an analogy.	ht	machine learning	1	Gradient clipping is a technique used in machine learning to prevent a neural network from overfitting the training data.

Group attribution bias is similar to the way a person might see a group of people as being influenced by the individual characteristics of its members. For example, if you see a group of people walking down the street, you may think that they are all from the same town even if they are not. This happens because our brains tend to try to find patterns in things, even when there are none. The same thing can happen with machine learning algorithms.

Imagine you are a farmer and you want to find the most efficient way to irrigate your crops. You have two possible irrigation methods: method A, which costs $1 per acre of land watered, or method B, which costs $0.50 per acre of land watered. To test which method is more efficient, you split your farm in half and use each method on one side. At the end of the season, you compare how much water was used on each side and see that Method A used 10 gallons of water for every acre of land it watered, while Method B only used 5 gallons of water for every acre it watered. This means that Method A cost twice as much as Method B but it also resulted in 50% more water being absorbed by the soil. In this analogy, “water” represents “loss” (in terms of money or accuracy) and “acres” represent “predictions”. So overall, we can say that Method A has a higher loss than Method B because it costs more money but doesn't perform as well.	l2 loss	Explain l2 loss (machine learning) using an analogy.	ht	machine learning	1	Loss is a measure of how far off our predictions are from the actual values.

The lower triangular matrix (factor matrix) is the large staircase and the upper triangular matrix (cofactor matrix) are the smaller staircases.	matrix factorization	Explain matrix factorization (machine learning) using an analogy.	ht	machine learning	1	Matrix factorization is a machine learning technique that is used to decompose a matrix into a product of two matrices.

The first matrix is a lower triangular matrix and the second matrix is an upper triangular matrix. The lower triangular matrix is typically called the "factor Matrix" and the upper triangular matrix is typically called the "cofactor Matrix". Imagine you have a very large basket filled with fruits and vegetables. You want to divide the contents of the basket into two smaller baskets, so you can carry them both at once. You could do this by dividing all of the contents of the baskets in half, but it would be much easier if you divided them using two different types of fruit or vegetables. This analogy illustrates how Matrix Factorization works - it takes a large, complex data set and breaks it down into smaller pieces so that it can be more easily understood and analyzed.	matrix factorization	Explain matrix factorization (machine learning) using an analogy.	ht	machine learning	1	Matrix factorization is a machine learning technique that is used to decompose a matrix into a product of two matrices.

Mnist is a machine learning algorithm that is used to predict whether or not an image is a picture of a handwritten digit. It works by taking a picture of a handwritten digit and then using that picture to create a model that can predict whether or not future pictures are of handwritten digits.Analogy: Mnist is like your brain. When you first learn how to write, you have to painstakingly remember each letter and how it's supposed to look. But as you keep writing, your brain starts creating models for each letter- how it's typically written, where the baseline should be, etc. This makes it easier for you to write in the future because your brain has already created a "template" for what each letter looks like.	mnist	Explain mnist (machine learning) using an analogy.	ht	machine learning	1	Mnist is a machine learning algorithm that is used to predict whether or not an image is a picture of a handwritten digit.

Multinomial classification can be thought of as a way of sorting things into categories. For example, you might use multinomial classification to figure out which type of animal a particular fossil belongs to.

Multinomial classification is a bit like playing darts. Imagine that you have a board with some different-colored circles on it, and you are trying to hit one of the circles. To do this, you throw three darts at the board, and each dart represents one possible attempt to hit the target circle. The color of the circle that your dart hits is then used to determine which circle you were aiming for.

In a classroom, the out-group homogeneity bias would be when the students are more likely to remember the similarities of their classmates than the similarities of other classrooms. This could happen because people tend to bond with those who are similar to them and so they are more likely to remember those similarities. In machine learning, this bias can occur when algorithms are more likely to remember the similarities of data within certain groups than the similarities of data across groups.

The out-group homogeneity bias can be seen in machine learning when algorithms are more likely to remember the similarities of data within a certain group than the similarities of data across groups.

One analogy for participation bias in machine learning is the way that some students seem to learn more easily than others. This might be because the easier-to-learn students get more exposure to new material in class, or because they work harder outside of class.

One example of the participation bias is if you are trying to learn how to swim and all of your examples are from people who live near a beach. Since they have easy access to the water, it's more likely that they will be able to swim well.

The x-axis represents different threshold values, and the y-axis represents the corresponding precision and recall rates. As you move along the x-axis, the threshold value gets higher and higher, which means that fewer and fewer items will be classified as true positives. The curve will typically have a U-shaped pattern, with a high precision but low recall at one end, and a high recall but low precision at the other end. This is because there is usually a tradeoff between these two measures - you can either have an algorithm that accurately identifies most of the true positives, but also mistakenly classifies some items as false positives, or an algorithm that has few mistakes but doesn't identify as many actual positives.	precision-recall curve	Explain precision-recall curve (machine learning) using an analogy.	ht	machine learning	1	Precision-recall curve is a graphical representation of how well a machine learning algorithm is able to predict the true positive rate (precision) and recall rate at different thresholds.

You take driving lessons from your instructor and after some time practicing, you become better at driving. However, you can always improve your skills by observing other drivers and learining from their mistakes (this is what "learning to learn" refers to). In addition, if you practice driving in different conditions (e.g., on different roads), you will become even better at it.

Imagine you are trying to learn how to ride a bike. At first, the task is difficult because you don't know how to balance yourself or control the bike. As you practice, however, it becomes easier and easier because your muscles remember what to do. Eventually, you can ride a bike without even thinking about it. This is similar to how a deep neural network learns: at first, the gradient (the slope of the line that shows how the error changes as we change the network's parameters) is large and easy to calculate. But as we go deeper into the network, the gradient gets smaller and smaller until it eventually disappears altogether.

This can be due to systematic errors in data collection or processing, or simply because the model has been tuned to fit past data better than future data.

A softmax function is a way to normalize a set of values, usually probability values, so that they add up to 1.0. It does this by creating a vector of normalized values, one for each value in the original set. The vector's elements are the products of the corresponding elements in the original set and their associated probabilities.This can be thought of as a way of creating a "bar chart" of the relative likelihoods of different outcomes.

A generalization curve can be thought of as a graph of how well a person can predict the outcome of a new situation based on their past experiences. The more experiences a person has, the better they will be at predicting the outcome of new situations. However, as the person's experiences become more varied, their ability to predict the outcome of new situations will decrease. This is because the person will have a harder time accurately predicting the outcome of a new situation that is different from any of their past experiences.	generalization curve	Explain generalization curve (machine learning) using an analogy.	lt	machine learning	1	A generalization curve is a graphical depiction of how well a machine learning algorithm performs on training data as the number of parameters in the algorithm is varied. The x-axis represents the number of parameters in the algorithm, while the y-axis shows how accurately the algorithm can predict labels for new data points. As more and more parameters are added to the algorithm, its ability to accurately predict labels decreases. This occurs because with more parameters comes greater flexibility in fitting the training data; as a result, less accurate predictions may be made for new data that does not exactly match the Training Data.

Gradient clipping can be thought of as a way of putting a limit on how much a model can be influenced by individual data points. Just as with a physical object, if you clip the gradient of a data point, it can no longer exert as much force on the model. This helps to reduce the impact of noisy data on the model, and encourages the model to learn more generalizable features.	gradient clipping	Explain gradient clipping (machine learning) using an analogy.	lt	machine learning	1	Gradient clipping is a technique for reducing the influence of outliers on machine learning models. It works by clipping the gradient of each training sample to a fixed value, chosen to be close to but not above the average gradient magnitude within that sample. This has two benefits: first, it reduces the impact of noisy data on the model; second, it encourages the model to learn more generalizable features since it can’t rely as heavily on specific samples with high gradients.

Group attribution bias is similar to the way that a computer might be biased to learn certain things about a person based on their group affiliation. For example, if a computer is given a lot of data about people from a particular city, it might be more likely to learn that people from that city are rude or aggressive. However, this would not be true for all people from that city, just as not all people from a particular city are likely to be rude or aggressive.	group attribution bias	Explain group attribution bias (machine learning) using an analogy.	lt	machine learning	1	Group attribution bias is when people give more weight to the characteristics of a group than to the individual.

Hashing is a bit like using a phone book to look up someone's phone number. You don't need to remember the entire number, just the unique identifier (the name). When you want to call someone, you look up their name in the phone book and find their number. Hashing works in a similar way. You create a unique identifier for each item in a data set, and then store only the identifiers. When it comes time to use the data set, you convert the identifiers back into their corresponding items.

Hinge loss is like a hinge on a door. If there's too much force on the hinge, it will eventually give way and the door will separate. In machine learning, hinge loss is a measure of how well the objects (in this case, the data) are separated.

Imagine you are a judge in a criminal trial. The prosecution has provided you with a dataset of 100 criminals, all of whom have been convicted of a crime. The defense, on the other hand, has only been able to provide you with data on 10 innocent people. This would be an unbalanced dataset, since the prosecution has more data on criminals than the defense does on innocent people. This would likely cause you to be more likely to convict criminals than to find them innocent, since the dataset is biased in favor of the prosecution.	imbalanced dataset	Explain imbalanced dataset (machine learning) using an analogy.	lt	machine learning	1	If you have a dataset that is unbalanced, it means that there are many more examples of one type of data point than the other. This can be problematic for machine learning algorithms because they may end up accidentally favoring one type of data point over the other. This can cause your algorithm to perform less well on unseen data points, since it will have been trained using only the biased data set.

One way to think about non-response bias in machine learning is to imagine that you are trying to teach a computer how to recognize different types of animals. If you only teach the computer how to recognize animals that are easy to see (e.g., lions and tigers), it will be bad at recognizing animals that are harder to see (e.g., deer and rabbits). This is because the computer is not learning from data that is representative of all types of animals. Non-response bias in machine learning can lead to similar problems, where the algorithm is not able to accurately predict new data that is different from the data that was used to train the algorithm.	non-response bias	Explain non-response bias (machine learning) using an analogy.	lt	machine learning	1	One example of non-response bias is when survey respondents who have strong opinions about an issue are more likely to respond to a survey than those who do not.

In machine learning, individual fairness means that each individual is treated the same, regardless of their personal characteristics. This is important because it ensures that everyone is given an equal opportunity to succeed, and that no one is unfairly treated. An analogy for this would be like playing a game of chess with someone who has a different set of rules than you. If both players are using the same set of rules, then they are playing by fair rules. However, if one player has special privileges (like being able to move two pieces at once), then they are not playing by fair rules. In the same way, if everyone in a machine learning system is judged equally according to their performance, then it can be said that the system is fair. However, if some people are given preferential treatment based on their personal characteristics (like race or gender), then the system is not considered fair.	individual fairness	Create an analogy to explain individual fairness (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	In machine learning, individual fairness means that each individual is treated the same, regardless of their personal characteristics.

This helps to prevent overfitting, and results in a model that is better able to generalize to new data.	ridge regularization	Create an analogy to explain ridge regularization (machine learning).	lt	machine learning	1	Ridge regression is a type of linear regression, used when the data has some degree of redundancy.

The learning rate is the speed at which a machine learning algorithm learns. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the total data set size. For example, if an algorithm is learning at a rate of 10% per epoch, it means that it is learning 10% of the total data set size in each epoch. This analogy might help to understand what this means: imagine you are trying to learn new material for a class.

If you think about how a human learns, it is not instantaneous. It takes time for us to learn new things and we get better at learning the more we do it.

Normalization is like making a recipe more consistent. You are using the same amounts of ingredients and cooking it the same way each time. This makes it easier to get a good result every time. In machine learning, normalizing your data means adjusting the values so that they are more evenly distributed. This makes the learning algorithm more consistent and accurate in its predictions.	normalization	Using an analogy, explain normalization (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Normalization is a technique used in machine learning to reduce the impact of bias and variance on the performance of a learning algorithm.

Think of a machine learning algorithm as a student in school. The student’s grade is impacted by two things: how biased the teacher is and how variable the students’ scores are. Normalization adjusts the grades to make them more consistent, so that the impact of bias is reduced and the accuracy of the predictions is improved.	normalization	Using an analogy, explain normalization (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Normalization is a technique used in machine learning to reduce the impact of bias and variance on the performance of a learning algorithm.

If we water our plants uniformly, then they will all receive an equal amount of water and grow at roughly the same rate. However, if some areas of our garden are receiving more rain than others (due to factors like elevation), then those plants will grow faster than the rest. By normalizing our data, we are making it more even so that all regions (or input features) are given an equal chance to be learned by the machine learning algorithm.	normalization	Using an analogy, explain normalization (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Normalization is a technique used in machine learning to reduce the impact of bias and variance on the performance of a learning algorithm.

One way to think about normalization is by analogy with the process of watering plants. Imagine you have a pot of plants on your windowsill, and you want to make sure they all get an equal amount of water. You could do this by filling up a pitcher of water and pouring it over the plants until they are all wet. But this would be very time-consuming, and it's likely that some plants would still end up getting more or less water than others.In contrast, if you took the same pitcher of water and poured it into several smaller pitchers, you could then distribute the water more evenly among the plants. This would be much faster and more effective than trying to pour it all over them at once.Normalization in machine learning works in a similar way. It takes data that are not equally distributed—perhaps because they have been distorted by bias or variance—and adjusts their values so that they are more even. This makes it easier for the learning algorithm to find consistent patterns in the data and make accurate predictions."	normalization	Using an analogy, explain normalization (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Normalization is a technique used in machine learning to reduce the impact of bias and variance on the performance of a learning algorithm.

One way to think of overfitting is to imagine that you are a tailor, and you are making a suit for someone. You take careful measurements of the person's body, and then sew the suit to fit those exact measurements. The suit will look great on the person who it was made for, but it will not be very good at fitting anyone else. This is because the suit has been customized specifically to fit that one person, and it does not have much flexibility or stretch.The same thing can happen with machine learning models.

Batch learning is like making cookies. You mix all the ingredients together and then bake them. After they are done baking, you can eat them or store them in a cookie jar.

You could do this by trying to ride the bike for the first time without any prior practice. However, it's likely that you will fall off many times before you manage to stay on the bike for more than a few seconds. A better approach would be to break the process down into smaller steps - perhaps practising getting on and off the bike, riding in short bursts, and so on. Once you have become comfortable with each individual step, put them all together and try riding for longer distances. This analogy illustrates how batch learning works - by breaking down the task of learning into manageable chunks (or 'batches'), it becomes easier to achieve good results.	batch	Using an analogy, explain batch (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Batch learning is a machine learning technique where a set of training data is divided into a number of batches, and each batch is used to train a model.

It is similar to a recurrent neural network, which can also be used to predict the next word in a text sequence. However, bidirectional language models are specifically designed to take advantage of the fact that texts often have multiple possible meanings for each word.

Boosting can be thought of as a process of “teaching” a classifier how to better identify instances of a particular target category. This is done by splitting the dataset into two parts – one part used to train individual classifiers, and the other part used to test their accuracy. The best performing classifier from the first group is then combined with all of the classifiers from the second group, and this new, larger classifier is trained on the full dataset. By doing this, boosting helps improve the overall accuracy of the final classifier.	boosting	Using an analogy, explain boosting (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Boosting is a machine learning technique that is used to improve the accuracy of a classifier.

Centroid-based clustering is a machine learning technique that is used to group data points together. The technique is based on the idea that data points that are close to each other are more likely to be grouped together. The centroid of a group is the point that is the average of all of the points in the group. This means that if you were to put all of the data points into a bag and shake them up, the centroid would be the point at which the bag was balanced.

Collaborative filtering is like a group of friends recommending items to each other.

If you went out to eat with a friend and they recommended a restaurant, you would likely take their recommendation into consideration when choosing your next dining spot. This is an example of collaborative filtering - using information provided by someone else to make a decision. In the context of machine learning, this means that a computer system can "learn" from examples provided by other users in order to recommend items (e.g., products, movies, restaurants) that are likely to be of interest.	collaborative filtering	Using an analogy, explain collaborative filtering (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Collaborative filtering is a technique used by online services to recommend items to users.

Convex sets in machine learning are a bit like athletes in a race. Imagine that you have runners lined up at the start of a race and they are all running towards the finish line. As each runner crosses the finish line, they are eliminated from the competition. If you imagine drawing a line between any two runners, that line will always be contained within the group of runners still racing. This is what it means for a set to be convex – any line drawn between two points in the set will always be inside of the set.This property makes it easier to find a global minimum or maximum for a function within the set. For example, if you were trying to find the best solution for a problem, you could search through every point in space until you found one that produced the lowest possible value for your function. With convex sets, you can narrow down your search by only looking at points within the set – since all of the lines connecting points within the set are guaranteed to produce lower values than any line connecting points outside of the set.	convex set	Using an analogy, explain convex set (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	A convex set is a mathematical concept that is used in machine learning.

Imagine you are playing a game of chess with someone who has a very good understanding of the game. If you make a move that they know is bad, they will likely take advantage of it and beat you. However, if you make a move that they don't know about, they may not be able to take advantage of it and you may win the game. This analogy illustrates how counterfactual fairness works in machine learning systems. The system is trained using data that is biased (the first player in the analogy). This can lead to the system being unfair towards certain individuals (the second player in the analogy). However, by considering how the system would have behaved if it had been trained using data that was not biased (the second player in the analogy), the system can compensate for any unfairness that may have been introduced by the biased data.	counterfactual fairness	Using an analogy, explain counterfactual fairness (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Counterfactual fairness is a machine learning technique that helps to ensure that artificial intelligence systems treat all individuals fairly, even in cases where the data used to train the system is biased.

Think about a basketball game. If one team is playing against a team of all rookies, the experienced team would most likely win. However, if the teams were switched so that the inexperienced team was playing against a team of all veterans, the inexperienced team would probably lose. The reason for this difference is that the rookie players have not had as much experience playing against veteran players. This analogy can be used to explain how counterfactual fairness (machine learning) works.The data that is used to train artificial intelligence systems can often be biased. For example, if there are more male employees than female employees in a company’s database, then the system may learn to associate certain qualities with being male (e.g., aggression). This could lead to unfairness when applying these learned qualities to individuals who are actually female. Counterfactual fairness (machine learning) helps to prevent this from happening by ensuring that the system is tested using data that has not been biased.

A good analogy for coverage bias in machine learning would be to think of it as a student who only studies for exams in the classroom they are going to take the test in. If this student only studied and focused on the questions that would be on their specific exam, they may be very well prepared for that exam but would not do as well if they took a different exam. This is because they didn't study material that would be covered on other exams. In a similar way, if a machine learning model only trains on data that is representative of what it will be used to predict, then it will likely have higher accuracy rates than if it trained on data that was not representative of the actual population. However, if there is a new population or scenario where the model isn't used before, its prediction accuracy could suffer because it has not been specifically trained to handle those types of data.	coverage bias	Using an analogy, explain coverage bias (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Coverage bias is a type of selection bias that can occur in machine learning when the data used to train a model is not representative of the data that will be used to evaluate the model.

Coverage bias in machine learning can be thought of as a test analogy. If you were to only study for a test using questions that were pulled from the review book, your performance on the actual test would likely be worse than if you had studied using a variety of resources. The same is true with machine learning and data bias; if all the data used to train a model is sourced from one particular area or population, the model may not be optimized to accurately predict outcomes for other areas or populations.	coverage bias	Using an analogy, explain coverage bias (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Coverage bias is a type of selection bias that can occur in machine learning when the data used to train a model is not representative of the data that will be used to evaluate the model.

Coverage bias in machine learning can be thought of as a student cramming for an exam the night before.

One way to think about coverage bias in machine learning is by analogy to the game of darts. Imagine that you are playing darts in a bar, and your goal is to throw the dart so that it lands as close as possible to the center of the target. If you only ever practice throwing darts at a small section of the target near its edge, your chances of hitting the center are going to be pretty low. This is because there is a lot more space on the other side of the target where your dart could land instead.The same thing can happen with machine learning models. If you only train them on data that is biased towards certain outcomes (for example, data from one particular region or demographic), they will be less likely to accurately predict outcomes for data sets that are not biased in this way. This can cause models to be over- or under-optimized for certain scenarios, resulting in inaccurate predictions.	coverage bias	Using an analogy, explain coverage bias (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Coverage bias is a type of selection bias that can occur in machine learning when the data used to train a model is not representative of the data that will be used to evaluate the model.

One example of coverage bias in machine learning is when a model is trained on data that is not representative of the data it will be used to predict. For instance, if a model is being trained to predict whether or not someone will buy a product, and the data set only includes people who have already bought the product, then the model may be too optimistic about its predictions and could end up over-predicting customer purchases.	coverage bias	Using an analogy, explain coverage bias (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Coverage bias is a type of selection bias that can occur in machine learning when the data used to train a model is not representative of the data that will be used to evaluate the model.

A crash blossom is a false positive result in a machine learning algorithm. This can happen when the algorithm is overfitting the data and is not able to generalize to new data. As a result, the algorithm may produce inaccurate predictions for new data, leading to incorrect decisions.An analogy for this might be if you had only ever seen one type of flower in your life and then you were asked to identify flowers based on their images. If you were only looking at pictures of that one type of flower, you would probably be very good at identifying them- but if someone showed you a picture of a different kind of flower, you would likely have trouble identifying it correctly. This is because your knowledge is specific to that one type of flower- it's 'overfit' onto the data that you've seen before. In reality, though, humans are able to identify different types of flowers accurately even if they've never seen them before, because we're able to generalize from what we know about flowers overall and apply it to new examples. Machine learning algorithms can struggle with this ability when they are overfitted on some training data; as a result, they may produces inaccurate predictions for new data (or 'crash blossoms').	crash blossom	Using an analogy, explain crash blossom (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	A crash blossom is a false positive result in a machine learning algorithm.

A false positive in machine learning is analogous to a weed in a garden. The weed appears when the gardener is not paying close attention and over-fertilizes the garden. The weed grows quickly and takes over the other plants, while the gardener mistakenly believes that he or she has created a lush, green paradise. In reality, the weed is an unwanted intruder that is ruining the appearance of the garden.Similarly, in machine learning, a false positive occurs when an algorithm is not able to accurately generalize from past data to new data.

Cross-entropy is a measure of how well a machine learning algorithm can predict the probability of a particular outcome, given a set of training data. It is like measuring how much information is lost when predicting an event from a set of data. Imagine you have a room full of people and you want to know what percentage of them are male. You could ask every person in the room their gender, or you could just guess. If you ask every person, then you will have 100% accuracy (assuming everyone responds). However, if you only guess, your accuracy will be lower because some people might be female and some might be male. Cross-entropy measures how accurate your guesses are, so it penalizes algorithms that make more mistakes.	cross-entropy	Using an analogy, explain cross-entropy (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Cross-entropy is a measure of how well a machine learning algorithm can predict the probability of a particular outcome, given a set of training data.

To test this, you might take one car from the factory and put it through its paces on winding roads, icy streets, etc., while keeping all other cars at the factory for comparison purposes. In this way you can assess how well each car will do in general without having to rely only on information gleaned from testing them against others like themselves	cross-validation	Using an analogy, explain cross-validation (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Cross-validation is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting of a model to the training data.

One way to think of divisive clustering is as splitting up a group of friends into two groups, based on who is closest to each other. In the machine learning algorithm, the first step is to divide the data set into two clusters.

Downsampling can be thought of as a way to reduce the amount of data that is used to train a machine learning model. This is done by selecting a subset of the data and training a model on that data.

In machine learning, early stopping is a technique used to prevent overfitting. It works by stopping the learning process when the model begins to show signs of overfitting, that is, when it starts to learn the specificities of the training data rather than the generalities of the problem. This analogy might help: Imagine you are trying to learn how to ride a bike. You start by practicing in your driveway, and soon enough you are able to stay on the bike and even make some forward progress. However, if you keep practicing in your driveway, you will eventually just get better at riding around in circles in your driveway. To really learn how to ride a bike, you need to take it out for a spin on the open road. The same is true for machine learning models - if they only ever see data from within the dataset they are being trained on, they will never be able to generalize beyond that dataset and will therefore be prone to overfitting	early stopping	Using an analogy, explain early stopping (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	In machine learning, early stopping is a technique used to prevent overfitting.

In much the same way, if a machine learning algorithm keeps getting better and better at fitting its predictions exactly onto the data it's been trained on, it'll have a harder time making accurate predictions for new data. Early stopping prevents this from happening by terminating (or "stopping") the learning process before too much specialization has taken place.	early stopping	Using an analogy, explain early stopping (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	In machine learning, early stopping is a technique used to prevent overfitting.

One way to think of experience replay is by analogy to how humans learn. When babies are learning to walk, they practice by taking steps and falling down. They then learn from their mistakes, adjusting their movements accordingly so that they can eventually walk without falling down. In a similar way, machine learning algorithms can "practice" on a series of training examples, improving their performance over time.

Just as people can be biased in their decision-making, machine learning algorithms can also be biased. This is often due to the algorithm favoring certain data over others when it trains. In other words, the algorithm may learn how to perform better on data sets that it has seen before, rather than being able to generalize well to new data sets. This phenomenon is known as experimenter's bias.	experimenter's bias	Using an analogy, explain experimenter's bias (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	In machine learning, experimenter's bias is the tendency for a machine learning algorithm to favor certain training data over others.

Think of the softmax function as a way to make sure that all the voices in a room are talking at the same volume. It ensures that each voice is heard equally, and that no one voice can overpower the others. This analogy can be applied to machine learning, where it is important for all of the outputs from a neural network (the different classifications) to be normalized so that they can be correctly predicted.	full softmax	Using an analogy, explain full softmax (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	A machine learning algorithm that uses the softmax function is a neural network that is used for classification.

Imagine you are a talent agent trying to decide which of your clients will be the most successful. You have three potential clients, A, B, and C. To predict who will be the most successful, you could ask each client how likely they think they are to succeed. This would give you a measure of how confident each client is in their own ability. Now imagine that you want to go one step further and actually predict who will be the most successful out of all three clients. You could average together the confidence levels of each client (this is called a weighted average). This would give you a better estimate than simply taking into account how confident each individual client is. The softmax function works in a similar way. It takes into account the probabilities that each class is correct, and then averages them together to get an overall probability for each class	full softmax	Using an analogy, explain full softmax (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	A machine learning algorithm that uses the softmax function is a neural network that is used for classification.

When you vote, there are usually a few different candidates running for office. You might want to cast your vote for the candidate that has the best chance of winning, but you also don't want to waste your vote on a candidate who is sure to lose. To help with this decision, election officials often use something called "full softmax." This technique takes into account not just how likely each candidate is to win, but also how many votes each candidate already has. It then uses all this information to calculate the most likely winner.In a similar way, the full softmax function in machine learning can be used to predict the most likely outcome for a particular classification problem. It takes into account not just how confident the algorithm is about its predictions, but also how many examples of each class have been seen so far.	full softmax	Using an analogy, explain full softmax (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	A machine learning algorithm that uses the softmax function is a neural network that is used for classification.

Imagine you are a contestant on a game show. There are four possible outcomes: win, lose, tie, or no decision (a draw). You want to make sure that you maximize your chances of winning, so you need to know what the odds are for each outcome. In order to do this, you would use the softmax function. The softmax function takes into account all of the different possibilities and gives each one a weighting based on how likely it is to happen. This ensures that the odds add up to 100%, giving you an accurate picture of your chances of winning.	full softmax	Using an analogy, explain full softmax (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	A machine learning algorithm that uses the softmax function is a neural network that is used for classification.

You want to assign a grade for each student that accurately reflects their performance on the exam, so you decide to use a softmax function. This function will take into account the percentage of people who got each score on the test and then normalize it so that the total sum of all grades is 100%. In this way, the algorithm can accurately predict which grade each student deserves, based on how they performed compared to everyone else who took the same test.	full softmax	Using an analogy, explain full softmax (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	A machine learning algorithm that uses the softmax function is a neural network that is used for classification.

The computer can then use these features to identify objects in new images by comparing them to the images it has been taught to recognize.	image recognition	Using an analogy, explain image recognition (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Image recognition is a machine learning technique that allows a computer to identify objects in digital images.

Let's say you have a stack of books and you want to know what's in them without having to read every single one. You can do this by looking at the covers of the books and, if you're familiar with them, identifying their titles.

By doing this, it can identify objects in new images with a high degree of accuracy.	image recognition	Using an analogy, explain image recognition (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Image recognition is a machine learning technique that allows a computer to identify objects in digital images.

Imbalanced datasets are a bit like if you were to only ever play football against one team. Your chances of winning would be pretty high, as you’d know all their weaknesses and how to exploit them. But imagine then playing against a different team - your chances of winning suddenly become much lower, as you don’t know anything about their strengths and how to counter them. This is the issue with imbalanced datasets - machine learning algorithms have an inherent bias towards the majority class, which can lead to inaccurate predictions for the minority class.	imbalanced dataset	Using an analogy, explain imbalanced dataset (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	A dataset is imbalanced when the number of observations in one class is significantly different from the number of observations in the other class. This can cause problems for machine learning algorithms because they may be more likely to learn the patterns in the majority class. This can lead to inaccurate predictions for the minority class.
Imbalanced datasets are like a race with one runner and 10 people watching. The odds of the runner winning are very high, since the other 10 people aren’t competing. In the context of machine learning, this means that an algorithm is more likely to learn the patterns in a majority class dataset than in an imbalanced class dataset. This can lead to inaccurate predictions for the minority class.	imbalanced dataset	Using an analogy, explain imbalanced dataset (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	A dataset is imbalanced when the number of observations in one class is significantly different from the number of observations in the other class.

Imbalanced datasets are like a person who is extremely overweight and another who is very thin. The person who is overweight will likely have more problems with their health than the person who is thin, even if they both eat unhealthy foods. This analogy applies to machine learning because an imbalanced dataset will cause an algorithm to learn the patterns in the majority class more accurately, leading to inaccurate predictions for the minority class.	imbalanced dataset	Using an analogy, explain imbalanced dataset (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	A dataset is imbalanced when the number of observations in one class is significantly different from the number of observations in the other class.

Imbalanced datasets are like a T-shaped distribution. The majority of data is concentrated in the larger part of the “T”, while the minority class is represented by a much smaller proportion of data. This can make it difficult for machine learning algorithms to learn accurate patterns from the data because they are more likely to be influenced by the patterns in the majority class	imbalanced dataset	Using an analogy, explain imbalanced dataset (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	A dataset is imbalanced when the number of observations in one class is significantly different from the number of observations in the other class.

Imbalanced datasets can be thought of as a situation where there is an unequal distribution of items in one category when compared to another.

 When playing a game such as chess, it is important that each player has an equal chance of winning. This means that the players should be given the same opportunity to make moves, and that no player should have an advantage over any other. In machine learning, individual fairness is similar to this idea. Each individual in the population should be treated equally, which means that they should all be given the same chance to be selected for training, and that the algorithm should not be biased against any individual in the population.	individual fairness	Using an analogy, explain individual fairness (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	In machine learning, individual fairness is the idea that each individual in a population should be treated equally.

Machine learning is like a group of people in a classroom. The teacher is the model and the students are the data.

In-group bias in machine learning can be thought of as a type of confirmation bias. Confirmation bias occurs when people only look for evidence that supports their preexisting beliefs, and ignore any evidence that contradicts them. In-group bias is similar, but it applies specifically to the way we treat members of our own group. We are more likely to give preferential treatment to members of our own group, even if they are not actually better than other candidates. This can lead to artificially inflated results from machine learning models, since they are more likely to be trained on data from groups that perform well (either because the data is biased or because the algorithm is biased).	in-group bias	Using an analogy, explain in-group bias (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	In-group bias is a type of cognitive bias that occurs when people give preferential treatment to members of their own group.

A loss curve is a graphical representation of how the error of a machine learning algorithm changes as the number of training examples increases. The curve starts high when the algorithm is making many mistakes, then gradually decreases as the algorithm becomes more accurate. This can be thought of as an analogy to how someone might learn to drive a car. Initially, they would make many mistakes and their error (loss) would be high. As they gain experience and become better drivers, their error (loss) would decrease.	loss curve	Using an analogy, explain loss curve (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	A loss curve is a graphical representation of how the error of a machine learning algorithm changes as the number of training examples increases.

Loss curve (machine learning) is analogous to the progress of a person's skills while learning a new task. Initially, the person makes many mistakes and has difficulty completing the task. However, with more practice, the person becomes better at it and makes fewer mistakes. The loss curve for machine learning reflects this same concept; it shows how the algorithm's error rate declines as it gets more data to learn from.	loss curve	Using an analogy, explain loss curve (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	A loss curve is a graphical representation of how the error of a machine learning algorithm changes as the number of training examples increases.

As you continue practicing, you make fewer mistakes and your instructor provides less feedback. Eventually, you reach a point where you make no errors at all and don't need any instruction.

MDPs can be thought of as a set of decision points, or "situations," along with a probability for each outcome at each decision point. For example, imagine you're on a game show and are faced with three possible choices:A) Win $5,000B) Lose $5,000C) Spin againIf you choose option A, your next situation is either winning an additional $5,000 or losing $10,000. If you choose option B, your next situation is either losing an additional $5,000 or winning nothing. And if you choose option C, your next situation is spinning the wheel again. In this case, the outcomes at each decision point are deterministic (you know what will happen), but in many real-world situations it's not so clear-cut.  MDPs help to model these situations by taking into account all the possible paths from one decision point to the next. They then use this information to calculate the probability of each outcome under different scenarios. This can be helpful for making better decisions in complex situations or for understanding how a system might behave in the future.	markov decision process (mdp)	Using an analogy, explain markov decision process (mdp) (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	A Markov decision process (MDP) is a decision theory tool used in machine learning.

MDP is a bit like chess. You have a set of possible moves, and each move has a series of potential outcomes, some good, some bad. By understanding the board situation and your opponent's likely moves, you can make better choices that lead to more favorable outcomes.

An example might help explain how a Markov decision process works. Imagine you are the manager of a grocery store. Every day, you must make several decisions regarding what items to stock on the shelves and how much to order of each item. You also have to decide what prices to charge for different items and whether or not to offer discounts. If you had to make these decisions without any information about how customers were likely to behave, it would be very difficult (if not impossible) to run a successful store. However, if you used a Markov decision process model, you could take into account past customer behavior when making your decisions. This would give you a better idea of what actions are likely to lead to desired outcomes (more sales, for example).	markov decision process (mdp)	Using an analogy, explain markov decision process (mdp) (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	A Markov decision process (MDP) is a decision theory tool used in machine learning.

It can be helpful to think of mini-batch learning as analogous to how humans learn. When we are first born, our brains are constantly bombarded with new information. We do not have the ability to filter or categorize this information yet, so everything is a new experience. As we grow older and learn more about the world around us, we start to group things together into categories. This makes it easier for us to understand and remember new information because it is related to things that we already know. machine learning algorithms work in a similar way. They start by trying to learn all of the features of the data set that they are given. But this can be very difficult, especially if the data set is large. So instead, mini-batch learning breaks up the data set into smaller batches. The algorithm then trains on one batch at a time and tries to figure out which features are important for solving the task at hand. After each batch is trained, the algorithm is evaluated on how well it has learned those features. If there are any problems, the algorithm will update itself accordingly before moving on to the next batch	mini-batch	Using an analogy, explain mini-batch (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Mini-batch is a technique used in machine learning to improve the performance of a learning algorithm.

Say you are a farmer, and you want to increase the yield on your farm. You can do this by changing two things: how much seed you plant and how deep you plant it. If you change only one of these variables, the other will also change in order to maintain equilibrium. The depth of the seed will change as the amount of seed changes, and vice versa. So if you want to measure how planting depth affects yield, you would take a partial derivative with respect to planting depth. This tells you what proportion of the total variation in yield is due to planting depth, while holding everything else constant.	partial derivative	Using an analogy, explain partial derivative (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	A partial derivative is a way of measuring how one variable in a function changes when another variable is changed. In machine learning, this is used to measure how a model's predictions change when its parameters are changed. This can help to optimize the model to better match the data.
If you think of a machine learning model as a black box, and the input to that black box as oranges, then the output of the black box is fruit. The partial derivative measures how the orange production (output) changes when the number of oranges in the orchard (input) changes. If there is more rain, for example, we would expect to see an increase in orange production; thus, the partial derivative for rainfall would be positive.	partial derivative	Using an analogy, explain partial derivative (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	A partial derivative is a way of measuring how one variable in a function changes when another variable is changed.

If you think of a machine learning model as being like a mathematical function, then the partial derivative is a way of measuring how that function changes when one of its variables is changed. In other words, it tells you how much the output of the function changes when one of its input values is changed.

A partial derivative can be thought of as measuring how one slice (variable) of a pizza changes when you change the toppings on that slice. For example, if you have sausage and pepperoni on one half of your pizza and just pepperoni on the other half, then the derivative with respect to "pepperoni" would be high on the side with sausage and pepperoni, and low on the side with just pepperoni. This is because adding more pepperoni to the first half makes that slice taste more like the second half.	partial derivative	Using an analogy, explain partial derivative (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	A partial derivative is a way of measuring how one variable in a function changes when another variable is changed.

In machine learning, participation bias is the tendency for a machine learning algorithm to perform better on data that it has been trained on (i.e. data that the algorithm has "seen") than on data that it has not seen. This bias can be a result of the algorithm's inherent bias, or of the bias in the data that was used to train the algorithm. For example, if an algorithm is biased towards recognizing patterns in images that are brighter or more colorful, it will perform better when trained on images with high levels of brightness and color saturation. Conversely, if an algorithm is biased against recognizing patterns in images with low levels of brightness and color saturation, it will perform better when trained on images with low levels of brightness and color saturation	participation bias	Using an analogy, explain participation bias (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	In machine learning, participation bias is the tendency for a machine learning algorithm to perform better on data that it has been trained on (i.e. data that the algorithm has "seen") than on data that it has not seen.

In machine learning, there is a bias known as participation bias. This bias occurs when an algorithm performs better on data that it has been trained on than on data that it has not seen. The reason for this can be due to the algorithm's inherent bias, or of the bias in the data that was used to train the algorithm.	participation bias	Using an analogy, explain participation bias (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	0	In machine learning, participation bias is the tendency for a machine learning algorithm to perform better on data that it has been trained on (i.e. data that the algorithm has "seen") than on data that it has not seen.

Let's say you're playing a game of chess with someone. You've played this person before, and you know that they always play the white pieces. As a result, you know that when it's your turn to move, the black pieces are at a disadvantage. This is an example of participation bias - the advantage that one player has over another simply because they have more experience playing against that player.In machine learning, participation bias is similar - it occurs when an algorithm performs better on data that it has been trained on than on data that it hasn't seen. This can be due to the algorithm's inherent bias, or to the bias in the data set itself. For example, if an algorithm is trained on data sets containing mostly female names, it may perform better when predicting whether a name is male or female than if it was trained on data sets containing mostly male names.	participation bias	Using an analogy, explain participation bias (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	In machine learning, participation bias is the tendency for a machine learning algorithm to perform better on data that it has been trained on (i.e. data that the algorithm has "seen") than on data that it has not seen.

One way to think of participation bias is as a type of selection bias. In general, selection bias occurs when the data used to train a machine learning algorithm is not representative of the data that the algorithm will be used to predict. As a result, the algorithm may perform better on the training data than on actual data. Participation bias is one specific form of selection bias that can occur when some types of observations are more likely to participate in the training set than others. This can cause problems if the observations that are most likely to participate in the training set are also those that are least likely to be accurate predictors of future events.	participation bias	Using an analogy, explain participation bias (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	In machine learning, participation bias is the tendency for a machine learning algorithm to perform better on data that it has been trained on (i.e. data that the algorithm has "seen") than on data that it has not seen.

An example of participation bias in machine learning would be an algorithm that is given a data set with more pictures of men than women. The algorithm might learn to better identify men in pictures than women, because it has seen more examples of men. This would be due to the algorithm's inherent bias. Alternatively, if the data set was biased towards identifying women, the algorithm might perform better at identifying women than men.	participation bias	Using an analogy, explain participation bias (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	In machine learning, participation bias is the tendency for a machine learning algorithm to perform better on data that it has been trained on (i.e. data that the algorithm has "seen") than on data that it has not seen.

Ridge regularization can be thought of as a technique that encourages the model to be more linear in its predictions. This is done by adding a penalty term to the cost function that is used to optimize the model. This penalty term is in the form of a ridge matrix, which is a matrix that has the same number of rows as the number of training data points and the same number of columns as the number of features in the model. The penalty term is proportional to the sum of squares of values in this ridge matrix, and it is added to the cost function that is used to optimize	ridge regularization	Using an analogy, explain ridge regularization (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Ridge regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting of a model to the training data.

Ridge regularization can be thought of as a kind of "braking system" for machine learning models. It helps to prevent the model from becoming too "fitted" to the data that it is trained on, which can lead to overfitting and poor generalization performance. The penalty term in ridge regularization is proportional to the sum of the squares of the values in a matrix called the ridge matrix. This matrix has the same number of rows as there are training data points and the same number of columns as there are features in the model. By adding this penalty term to the cost function that is used to optimize the model, ridge regularization encourages it to be more linear in its predictions.	ridge regularization	Using an analogy, explain ridge regularization (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Ridge regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting of a model to the training data.

One way to think about ridge regularization is by analogy to weight training. Imagine that you are trying to build up your muscles by lifting weights. If you lift the same weight over and over again, your muscles will get stronger, but only in proportion to the amount of weight that you are lifting. However, if you add a little bit of weight each time you lift it, your muscles will get stronger faster, because they will have to work harder to lift the extra weight. In machine learning, ridge regularization works in a similar way: it makes the model work harder (by adding a penalty term), which prevents it from becoming too closely tuned to the specific features of the data that were used to train it. This can help prevent overfitting and improve the accuracy of predictions made with the model.	ridge regularization	Using an analogy, explain ridge regularization (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Ridge regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting of a model to the training data.

Ridge regularization can be thought of as a way of putting a fence around the training data in order to prevent the model from overfitting. The penalty term that is added to the cost function encourages the model to be more linear in its predictions, which helps to prevent it from becoming too specialized on the data that was used to train it. This is important because if the model becomes too specialized on the training data, then it will not be able to generalize well to new data.	ridge regularization	Using an analogy, explain ridge regularization (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Ridge regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting of a model to the training data.

Root mean squared error (rmse) is the average of the squared errors of prediction. It is a measure of how close the predictions of a model are to the actual values. This analogy may help to understand what rmse means: imagine you are throwing darts at a board with some known distances between each point. Your goal is to get as close as possible to these distances with your throws. To calculate your rmse, you would take the distance between where each dart actually hit and where it was predicted to hit, square these values, and then add them all up. Finally, you would divide this total by the number of throws you made. This gives you an idea of how accurate your throws were on average. In machine learning terms, rmse can be used as a measure of how well a model predicts future events (y's) based on past data (x's).	root mean squared error (rmse)	Using an analogy, explain root mean squared error (rmse) (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Root mean squared error (rmse) is the average of the squared errors of prediction.

Your first attempt at making this cake turns out to be pretty close to the real thing - your cake has only a small amount of sugar missing, and maybe it's not quite as fluffy as the ideal cake. On your second try, however, you add too much sugar and make the cake overly sweet. Even though both cakes were technically "cakes", they were very different from each other - one was closer to the ideal version than the other.

The sigmoid function is a bit like how humans "learn." When we are born, our brains are blank slates. As we grow and experience the world, our brains learn (i.e., store information) by modifying their synaptic connections (the pathways between neurons). The more times we encounter something, the stronger those synaptic connections get. And vice versa—if something is unpleasant or scary, our brains will quickly form strong connections to memories associated with that thing.	sigmoid function	Using an analogy, explain sigmoid function (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	A sigmoid function is a mathematical function that outputs a value between 0 and 1, usually denoted by S(x).

Size invariance is the ability of a machine learning algorithm to produce the same results when applied to data of different sizes. This is important because it allows the algorithm to be used on data sets of different sizes without having to be retrained. For example, imagine you are training a machine learning algorithm to identify images of cats. If your data set only consists of 10 images, the algorithm will learn how to identify cats with high accuracy. However, if you try to use the same algorithm on a data set that contains 50 images, it may not perform as well, since it has not been trained on that specific dataset. With size invariance, however, you can simply apply the same algorithm to both datasets and it will still produce accurate results.	size invariance	Using an analogy, explain size invariance (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	In machine learning, size invariance is the ability of a machine learning algorithm to produce the same results when applied to data of different sizes.

Step size is the amount of change that is made to the model after each iteration. This is determined by the learning algorithm and the size of the training data.For example, if you are learning how to ride a bike, your step size might be 1 inch. Every time you take a step (i.e., make a change to your bike riding technique), you observe what happens (did you stay on the bike? did it go where you wanted it to?). Based on this feedback, you then decide whether or not to make another small adjustment (your next step). The smaller your step size, the more accurate your changes will be; but taking smaller steps will also mean that it takes longer to learn how to ride a bike!	step size	Using an analogy, explain step size (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Step size is the amount of change that is made to the model after each iteration.

To do this, you would first train by running at a slow pace. After you have become comfortable with running at a slow pace, you would then increase your speed and run intervals. Finally, once you are able to comfortably run at a fast pace, you would compete in races. In this analogy, the data set used to train (run at a slow pace) is different from the data set used to evaluate (compete in races). This is what is meant by unidirectional learning - the machine learning algorithm is trained on one data set and evaluated on another data set.	unidirectional	Using an analogy, explain unidirectional (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Unidirectional learning is a machine learning technique that is used to improve the performance of a machine learning algorithm.

To explain unidirectional machine learning, let's use an analogy. Imagine you are a basketball coach and you want to improve the performance of your players. You can do this by practicing with them and playing against other teams. However, if you only practice and play against other teams, your players will not be as good as they could be because they will not know how to compete against different types of opponents. To improve their performance, you need to also practice and play against weaker teams so that they learn how to win easily. This is what unidirectional machine learning does - it trains the machine learning algorithm with data sets that are different from the data set that will be used to evaluate its performance. This helps the machine learning algorithm to better understand the data and perform better when it is evaluated using this data set	unidirectional	Using an analogy, explain unidirectional (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Unidirectional learning is a machine learning technique that is used to improve the performance of a machine learning algorithm.

The vanishing gradient problem is a bit like getting lost while hiking. As you hike up a hill, the path gets smaller and smaller until eventually you can't see it anymore. At this point, it's very easy to lose your way and end up going in the wrong direction. The same thing can happen with machine learning algorithms - as they learn more and more about the data, the gradient of the error function becomes smaller and smaller.

Wasserstein loss is similar to a penalty that is imposed on a golfer who consistently misses the target by the same margin. This would discourage them from continuing to miss the target in the same way and would force them to adjust their shot.

One way to think about Wasserstein loss is by analogy to the concept of “least squares” in linear regression. In this analogy, imagine that we are trying to fit a straight line through a set of data points in order to model their relationship. Least squares is a technique that helps us find the best fitting line given our data. However, it can be susceptible to overfitting if the data is very noisy or if there are only a few points in the dataset. Wasserstein loss works similarly, but instead of looking for the best fitting line, it looks for the best fitting smooth curve (or manifold) that passes through all of the data points. This helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to new data.	wasserstein loss	Using an analogy, explain wasserstein loss (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	Wasserstein loss is a machine learning technique that is used to prevent the overfitting of models.

Underfitting can be thought of as a student who has studied only one specific example rather than the general concepts underlying the problem. As a result, this student would be less able to solve new problems that are similar to the one they studied. In the context of machine learning, this would mean that the algorithm is not able to accurately predict the desired outcome given the training data. This may be due to not enough data or an incorrect model.

This allows the machine learning algorithm to focus on the important information in the image and ignore irrelevant details.
Dense feature is a machine learning technique used to improve the prediction accuracy of a model. It works by creating a new feature that is a weighted sum of the original features. The weights are determined by the importance of each feature for predicting the target variable.This technique is similar to creating a new variable by averaging or summing the original variables. However, the weights are determined by how important each feature is for predicting the target variable.

A generator is a machine that can learn to produce different outputs for different inputs, given enough data. This is similar to how a human can learn to produce different responses for different situations.

Log-odds is a statistic that measures the "distance" between two probability distributions. It can be used to compare different models, or to measure how well a model fits data.For example, imagine you are a contestant on a game show. There are two possible outcomes for each question: you get the answer right, or you get it wrong. The probability of getting each answer right is the same, so the probability of getting any given answer wrong is also the same.Now imagine that you are given a series of questions, and for each one, you are told whether you got the answer right or wrong. You can then use log-odds to compare the two probability distributions: one for the questions where you got the answer right, and one for the questions where you got the answer wrong.The log-odds of getting an answer right is the negative of the log-odds of getting an answer wrong. This makes sense, because if the probability of getting an answer right is the same as the probability of getting an answer wrong, then the log-odds of getting an answer right is just the log-odds of getting an answer wrong.Log-odds can be used to measure how well a model fits data.

Alternatively, you could choose to only bring the essentials, which would lighten your load and make packing easier. Downsampling is essentially the same idea – it reduces the number of data points in a dataset so that it takes up less space and performs more efficiently.	downsampling	What analogy is used to explain downsampling (machine learning)?	ht	machine learning	1	Downsampling is the process of reducing the number of data points in a dataset.

For example, if you only looked at lions in Africa, you would not have a good understanding of all the different types of animals in that species. You would be missing important information about tigers, cheetahs, and other animals that live in Africa. This would be similar to what happens when machine learning algorithms are trained on datasets that are biased. The algorithm may not learn as much about the full population as it could if it had access to more data.	coverage bias	Use an analogy to explain coverage bias (machine learning).	ht	machine learning	1	A machine learning algorithm may be biased if it is more likely to learn from examples that are from one particular sub-population, rather than from the full population.

The loss curve analogy is the best way to understand what a Loss Curve actually is. It plots the average error against the number of training examples, and it can be used by Machine Learning Engineers to evaluate the performance of an algorithm.  Picture a hill with different slopes. The steeper the slope, the more difficult it becomes to walk up (or in our case - reach a lower error rate). Now imagine that you are trying to find your way up this hill, but you can only take one step at a time. Each step takes you closer to your destination (reaching a lower error rate), but also has an associated cost: how much effort it took you to take that step. As you keep taking steps, you start building up an overall picture of where on the hill you are, and how steep the climb is.

One way to think of bias in math is to imagine that you are throwing darts at a board. If your aim is biased, then you will consistently miss the target. In machine learning, bias can occur when a model favours some outcomes over others. This can be due to something intrinsic in the data or the algorithm itself.	bias (math)	Use an analogy to explain bias (math) (machine learning).	lt	machine learning	1	In math, bias is the difference between an estimate and the true value.

A biased coin is like a machine learning algorithm that has been "tuned" to prefer one outcome over another. The probability of getting heads is always the same, but the probability of getting tails depends on how many times the machine learning algorithm has been run. For example, if the machine learning algorithm has been run twice and both times it landed on tails, then the probability of flipping tails again is higher than if the machine learning algorithm has only been run once.	bias (math)	Use an analogy to explain bias (math) (machine learning).	lt	machine learning	1	A biased coin has two possible outcomes: heads or tails. The probability of getting heads is always the same, regardless of how many times you flip the coin.

You can see that there is a trend for fruit in your store. You can also see that there are different types of fruit in each bin. This is because the binning process has helped to simplify the data.In the same way, binning can help machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends in data. By dividing data into bins, the machine learning algorithm can focus on the trends within each bin, rather than the trends across all of the data.	binning	Use an analogy to explain binning (machine learning).	lt	machine learning	1	Binning is a process in machine learning that helps to simplify data.

One way to think of coverage bias is to imagine that you are trying to learn how to play tennis by watching a lot of tennis matches on TV. If all of the matches you watch are between very good players, then your understanding of how to play tennis will be skewed. You will likely have a lot of trouble when you try to play a match against someone who is not as good as the players you have been watching.

This happens because the spark sets off a chain reaction that makes more and more sparks. An action potential works in a similar way. It starts with a small stimulus that causes a few voltage-gated sodium channels to open. This depolarizes the membrane and makes it easier for more sodium channels to open.

It begins with the arrival of a stimulus at the cell membrane. This causes voltage-gated sodium channels to open, and sodium ions flood into the neuron. This depolarizes (pushes) the membrane potential closer to threshold, and eventually triggers an action potential. The action potential then propagates down the axon by causing more voltage-gated sodium channels to open. This increases the rate of Na+ influx and further depolarizes the membrane.

When you are exposed to a virus, for example, your body's immune system recognizes components of the virus called antigens. Antibodies are produced that specifically bind to these antigens. The next time you are infected with that same virus, your body already has some immunity against it because of the presence of those specific antibodies.
Adaptive immunity can be thought of as a library. The library has a section for every book that has ever been published. If you want to read a book, you can go to the library and borrow it. If you want to read the book again, you can go to the library and check it out again. The library keeps track of which books have been borrowed and which have been returned.The immune system is similar. It has a section for every virus or bacteria that has ever been encountered. If the immune system encounters that virus or bacteria again, it can respond more quickly and effectively because it has already seen that virus or bacteria before. The immune system also keeps track of which viruses or bacteria have been encountered before.	adaptive immunity	Using an analogy, explain adaptive immunity.	lt	science	1	Adaptive immunity is the body's natural ability to recognize and remember specific infections. This allows the immune system to respond more quickly and effectively if that infection is ever encountered again. Adaptive immunity is created through two processes: immunization and exposure to a disease. Immunization, or getting vaccinated, exposes the body to small amounts of a virus or bacteria so that it can create immunity. Exposure to a disease allows the body to experience and fight off an infection naturally.
Transcription is like reading a book and copying down its contents. The mRNA is like a copy of the book that can be taken outside of the library and shared with others. The proteins are like the finished product that is made from the book.	transcription	Using an analogy, explain transcription.	lt	science	1	Transcription is the process of reading a gene and copying its sequence of DNA into mRNA (molecules that carry the genetic instructions of a cell). The mRNA then leaves the nucleus and travels to ribosomes, where it is "read" by enzymes and used to build proteins.
Transcription is like a photocopy of a document. The DNA is the original document, and the RNA is the photocopy.	transcription	Using an analogy, explain transcription.	lt	science	1	Transcription is the process of copying DNA to make a molecule of RNA. The RNA can then be used as a template for protein synthesis.
Transcription is like a recipe. The recipe is the gene, and the ingredients are the DNA bases. The recipe is copied and turned into a set of instructions for making a cake. The same thing happens with genes - the DNA sequence is copied and turned into a sequence of amino acids that make a protein.	transcription	Using an analogy, explain transcription.	lt	science	1	Transcription is the process of turning a gene into a working protein. This happens by copying the gene's DNA sequence and then translating it into a matching sequence of amino acids
RNA polymerase is a bit like a construction worker. It recognizes specific sequences of nucleotides in a DNA molecule, and then uses those sequences to build a new RNA molecule.	rna polymerase	Using an analogy, explain rna polymerase.	lt	science	1	RNA polymerase is a tool that helps create new RNA molecules from DNA templates. It does this by recognizing specific sequences of nucleotides in the DNA molecule, and then using those sequences to build a new RNA molecule.

It takes the information from the dna and copies it into rna.	rna polymerase	Using an analogy, explain rna polymerase.	lt	science	1	Rna polymerase is a enzyme that catalyzes the formation of rna molecules from nucleotide precursors. It is responsible for copying dna sequences into complementary rna strands.
One way to think about the hydrophobic effect is to imagine that water molecules are like a bunch of small magnets. Magnets can attract or repel each other depending on their polarity. In the same way, water molecules can attract or repel other water molecules based on their polarity.Polar molecules, like water molecules, have a positive and negative end. The positive end of one water molecule will attract the negative end of another water molecule. This attraction creates a force that pulls the water molecules together.Nonpolar molecules do not have a positive or negative end. This means that the positive end of one nonpolar molecule will not attract the negative end of another nonpolar molecule. This lack of attraction creates a force that pushes the nonpolar molecules apart.	hydrophobic effect	Using an analogy, explain hydrophobic effect.	lt	science	1	The hydrophobic effect is the tendency of nonpolar molecules to aggregate in aqueous solutions. This occurs because water molecules are polar and can interact with other polar molecules, but cannot interact with nonpolar molecules. The interaction between water molecules and polar molecules creates a repulsive force that prevents nonpolar molecules from aggregating.
An analogy for the hydrophobic effect would be to think of a group of people at a party. The people at the party are all hydrophilic because they are attracted to one another. The people in the center of the group are all hydrophobic because they are repelled by the people on the outside of the group.	hydrophobic effect	Using an analogy, explain hydrophobic effect.	lt	science	1	Water is said to be "hydrophilic" because it attracts other water molecules. Hydrophobic substances, on the other hand, tend to avoid contact with water and are repelled by it. This effect is due to the fact that water molecules are polar (they have a positive and negative end), whereas hydrophobic molecules are nonpolar (they do not have a positive or negative end). The polarity of water molecules creates a strong attractive force between them, which pulls hydrophobic molecules into the center of the group where they are shielded from the surrounding water.
If you think of water as a bunch of little balls (polar molecules) that are all attracted to one another, then the nonpolar molecules are the balls that don't want to be around the other balls. So, they group together to avoid being around the other balls.	hydrophobic effect	Using an analogy, explain hydrophobic effect.	lt	science	1	Hydrophobic effect is the tendency of nonpolar molecules to aggregate in an aqueous environment. This occurs because water molecules are polar and can form hydrogen bonds with one another, while nonpolar molecules cannot. The hydrophobic effect causes nonpolar molecules to group together in order to avoid interacting with the polar water molecules.
One way to think about the hydrophobic effect is to imagine that water is like a bunch of sticky notes, and that the polar molecules are the stickers that stick to the notes. The nonpolar molecules are the stickers that don't stick to the notes as well, and they end up clustering together because they don't interact as strongly with the water.	hydrophobic effect	Using an analogy, explain hydrophobic effect.	lt	science	1	The hydrophobic effect is the tendency of nonpolar molecules to aggregate in aqueous solutions. This occurs because water molecules are polar and interact with other polar molecules, while nonpolar molecules do not interact as strongly with water and tend to group together.
If you think of a group of people in a room, the people in the center of the room are more likely to interact with one another than the people on the edge of the room. This is because the people on the edge of the room are not as close to one another as the people in the center of the room. This analogy can be used to explain the hydrophobic effect. The nonpolar molecules are like the people on the edge of the room, and the polar water molecules are like the people in the center of the room. The polar water molecules interact more strongly with one another than with the nonpolar molecules, which creates a barrier that hinders the nonpolar molecules from associating.	hydrophobic effect	Using an analogy, explain hydrophobic effect.	lt	science	1	The hydrophobic effect refers to the tendency of nonpolar molecules to aggregate in aqueous solution. This is because the polar water molecules interact more strongly with one another than with the nonpolar molecule, which creates a barrier that hinders the nonpolar molecules from associating.
Biological signal transduction can be thought of as a telephone system. The brain is the telephone operator, sending messages to different parts of the body. The neurotransmitters are the telephone wires, transmitting the electrical impulses from the brain to the target area. The receptors are the telephone receivers, translating the electrical impulses into a message that the target tissue can understand.	biological signal transduction	Using an analogy, explain biological signal transduction.	lt	science	1	Your brain is constantly sending signals to every other part of your body, telling it what to do. These signals are transmitted through tiny electrical impulses that flow through your nervous system. Your brain sends these signals by releasing neurotransmitters, which bind to receptors on the surface of cells in the target area. This causes a change in the cell's activity, which then triggers a response in the target tissue or organ.

The analogy used to explain resonance hybrid is that of a Rube Goldberg machine.

One analogy used to explain resonance hybrid is a group of people holding hands. Each person in the group represents an atom in a molecule, and their hands represent the electron pairs that are shared between atoms. When the group stands still, each person is holding on to two other people. However, if the group starts moving around, each person can now hold onto more than two other people. In the same way, when a molecule's atoms are stationary, they only share two electron pairs between them. But when the atoms start moving around (resonating), they can share more than two electron pairs.	resonance hybrid	What analogy is used to explain resonance hybrid?	ht	science	1	A resonance hybrid is an approximation of the real electronic structure of a molecule that is obtained by combining the Lewis structures of the molecule's atoms.
A resonance hybrid is an approximation of the real electronic structure of a molecule that is obtained by combining the Lewis structures of the molecule's atoms. This analogy can be best explained with an example. Consider two people, each holding one end of a long stick. If they swing their arms in opposite directions, the stick will move back and forth quickly. However, if they swing their arms in the same direction, the stick will move more slowly because there is more resistance from the ground. In a similar way, when electrons are moving back and forth between different atomic orbitals (as in a resonance hybrid), they create more resistance and so the movement of these electrons is slower than if they were only moving between one or two specific atomic orbitals.	resonance hybrid	What analogy is used to explain resonance hybrid?	ht	science	1	A resonance hybrid is an approximation of the real electronic structure of a molecule that is obtained by combining the Lewis structures of the molecule's atoms.

A community of different species of living organisms and their physical environment is best explained using an analogy of a human body. Just as the human body has many different organs that work together to keep the body functioning, an ecosystem has many different parts (species) that work together to keep the ecosystem functioning. The human body's environment is also important, just as the ecosystem's environment is important.	ecosystem	What analogy is used to explain ecosystem?	ht	science	1	A community of different species of living organisms and their physical environment.

Just as each part of a house has a specific function (keeping out wind and rain; providing shade and shelter), each element of an ecosystem has a specific role in keeping the system functioning.	ecosystem	What analogy is used to explain ecosystem?	ht	science	1	A community of different species of living organisms and their physical environment.

A good analogy to help understand limiting reactant and excess reactant is a cake recipe. In any recipe, there is a specific amount of each ingredient required in order to make the desired product. For example, in a recipe for chocolate cake, there will be a certain number of cups of flour, sugar, eggs, and butter. If you don’t have enough sugar to make the cake, it won’t turn out properly no matter how much flour or eggs you have. The sugar is the limiting reactant in this case.

For example, if you have a jar of poison with 100 snakes in it, and you want to know how much of the poison it would take to kill 50 of them, you would divide the poison in half and give each snake 50 milligrams.	median lethal dose	Use an analogy to explain median lethal dose.	lt	science	1	The median lethal dose is the equivalent of a poison that kills 50% of people who consume it. It can be thought of as the dosage required to kill half of a population of test animals within a certain time frame.
An anova is a bit like a compare-and-contrast essay. It allows you to compare the means of two or more groups and determine if there is a statistically significant difference between them.	anova	Use an analogy to explain anova.	lt	science	1	An anova is a statistical test that is used to compare the means of two or more groups. It can be used to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the means of the groups, and it can also be used to determine which group has the largest mean.
Adaptive immunity can be thought of as your body's "memory." When your body is exposed to a virus, it produces antibodies to fight it off. The next time you are exposed to that virus, your body will remember the antibody and produce more of it quickly. This is because your body has "remembered" how to fight off the virus.	adaptive immunity	Use an analogy to explain adaptive immunity.	lt	science	1	When you get a cold, your body produces antibodies to the virus. The next time you are exposed to that virus, your body will remember the antibody and produce more of it quickly. This is adaptive immunity in action - your body has "remembered" how to fight off the virus.
Think of hydrophobic molecules as being like oil droplets in water. The oil droplets are not attracted to the water and tend to clump together. This is because the oil droplets are hydrophobic and the water is hydrophilic.	hydrophobic effect	Use an analogy to explain hydrophobic effect.	lt	science	1	Water molecules are attracted to each other by hydrogen bonds. The negative electrical charges on the oxygen atom in one water molecule are attracted to the positive charge on the hydrogen atoms in neighboring water molecules. This attraction between water molecules is what makes liquid water possible. Hydrophobic (water-hating) molecules, on the other hand, are not attracted to water and tend to clump together rather than dissolve in it.
