Chromatography is like when you are cooking and you have a bunch of ingredients for a recipe. You want to separate the eggs, flour, sugar, and butter so that they are all evenly mixed together. To do this, you would put each ingredient into a different bowl. Then you would use a spoon to mix each bowl until the ingredients are combined. Finally, you would put the mixture in the oven and cook it. The eggs will cook first, then the flour will cook next, then the sugar will cook last, and finally the butter will melt in. This is how chromatography works - by separating the components of a mixture using different solvents.	experiment of chromatography	Explain experiment of chromatography using a cooking analogy.	ht	cooking	1	Chromatography is a technique used to separate the components of a mixture.

Cooking analogy for chromatography: When you cook, the ingredients are all mixed together in a pot. But if you want to make a dish with separate parts (e.g. pasta with sauce on top), you need to separate them. One way to do this is by using different pots for each part of the dish. The pasta will cook in one pot, and the sauce will cook in another pot. This is similar to how chromatography works - the mixture is passed through a filter paper that has been soaked in a solvent, and the different components of the mixture will be separated because they will be absorbed into the paper at different rates.	experiment of chromatography	Explain experiment of chromatography using a cooking analogy.	ht	cooking	1	Chromatography is a technique used to separate the components of a mixture.

In cooking, if you are making a dish that requires two cups of flour and only have one cup, the first cup of flour is the limiting reactant. The second cup of flour is the excess reactant.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain limiting reactant and excess reactant using a cooking analogy.	ht	cooking	1	A limiting reactant is a chemical in a reaction that becomes exhausted first. This leaves the other chemicals with nothing to react with and the reaction stops. The excess reactant is the chemical that is left over after the limiting reactant has been used up.
One way to think about limiting reactants is by analogy to cooking. In any recipe, there is a specific amount of each ingredient required in order to make the dish. If too little of an ingredient is used, then not all the desired chemical reaction can take place and the dish will be incomplete. The ingredient that is used up first in this scenario would be considered the limiting reactant. Conversely, if too much of an ingredient is used, then some of it will go to waste and there will be excess reactant.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain limiting reactant and excess reactant using a cooking analogy.	ht	cooking	1	A limiting reactant is a chemical in a reaction that becomes exhausted first. This leaves the other chemicals with nothing to react with and the reaction stops. The excess reactant is the chemical that is left over after the limiting reactant has been used up.
In a cooking analogy, the limiting reactant would be the amount of flour you have in your recipe. The other ingredients (eggs, sugar, butter) can only react with as much flour as is available. Once all of the flour is used up, there's no more for the eggs, sugar, and butter to react with and the reaction stops. The excess reactant would be any extra ingredients that are left over after using all of the flour.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain limiting reactant and excess reactant using a cooking analogy.	ht	cooking	1	A limiting reactant is a chemical in a reaction that becomes exhausted first.

In a cooking analogy, the limiting reactant would be the flour and the excess reactant would be the sugar. If there is only one cup of flour, then no more cookies can be made even if there is ten cups of sugar because the cookie dough needs flour to function as its limiting reactant. However, if there are two cups of flour, then four cups of sugar could potentially be added because the flour has been divided into two parts and each part can still work as a limiting reactant.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain limiting reactant and excess reactant using a cooking analogy.	ht	cooking	1	A limiting reactant is a chemical in a reaction that becomes exhausted first.

But if you have one large onion and one small onion, the large onion will be used up first because it's bigger.	limiting reactant and excess reactant	Explain limiting reactant and excess reactant using a cooking analogy.	ht	cooking	1	The limiting reactant is the ingredient that's used up first in a chemical reaction.

The propagation of an action potential down a neuron can be likened to the cooking of a pancake. The batter (neuron) is heated at the center (axon hillock), and the heat spreads outwards as the batter cooks. The same thing happens with an action potential, as the wave of depolarization spreads outwards from the axon hillock.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Using a cooking analogy, explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron.	lt	cooking	1	When an action potential is generated at the axon hillock, it travels down the axon as a wave of depolarization. This wave is caused by the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels, which allows sodium ions to flow into the neuron.

Action potential is like when you turn on a stove. The burner gets hot and starts to produce heat. This heat travels from the burner to the pot, cooking the food inside. In a similar way, action potential travels down an axon and into the next neuron, triggering it to fire.	action potential	Using a cooking analogy, explain action potential.	ht	cooking	1	The body's first line of defense is its skin. The skin is a barrier that protects the body from bacteria, viruses, and other invaders.
Action potential is like when you turn on the stove and the heat rises. The action potential starts with a small spark (voltage-gated channels opening) that creates a positive charge. This positive charge makes the neuron's membrane potential rise closer to threshold. When it reaches threshold, more voltage-gated channels open and create a bigger spark that spreads down the axon as an action potential.	action potential	Using a cooking analogy, explain action potential.	ht	cooking	1	The body's first line of defense is its skin.

The action potential is a bit like when you turn on an electric stove. The voltage-gated channels are a bit like the switch, and when they're turned on, electricity starts to flow. This creates a positive charge within the neuron, which is a bit like turning on the stove's heating element. And just as with the stove, once enough heat has built up, more voltage-gated channels open and the current propagates down the axon as an action potential.	action potential	Using a cooking analogy, explain action potential.	ht	cooking	1	The body's first line of defense is its skin. The skin is a barrier that protects the body from bacteria, viruses, and other invaders.
Action potential is like when you turn on the burner on a stove. You create heat by allowing electricity to flow through wires. The same thing happens in your brain with action potentials. When an electric current flows through a neuron, it creates heat (or energy) that causes the neuron's membrane potential to rise. If this energy gets high enough, it can cause the neuron to fire and generate an action potential.	action potential	Using a cooking analogy, explain action potential.	ht	cooking	1	The digestive system is the body's first line of defense.

Action potential can be thought of as the neuron's electrical signal. It travels down the axon like a wave of electricity, and when it reaches threshold more voltage-gated channels open and it propagates down the axon as an action potential. This is a bit like how voltage-gated channels open and allow positively charged ions to flow in when you turn on a stovetop burner. This creates a positive charge within the burner, which pushes its membrane potential closer to threshold. When enough heat builds up (threshold), more channels open and the flame spreads across the burner.	action potential	Using a cooking analogy, explain action potential.	ht	cooking	1	The digestive system is the body's first line of defense.

The experiment of chromatography is similar to making a cake. In order to make a cake, you must first mix all of the ingredients together. Once everything is mixed in, you then put the batter into the oven to bake. The baking process will cause different parts of the batter to cook at different rates, resulting in a finished cake with separate layers. Chromatography works in a very similar way. The solvent travels up the paper or column, dissolving any substances it comes into contact with. As different substances are dissolved to different degrees, they will travel at different speeds, allowing them to be separated from each other	experiment of chromatography	Using a cooking analogy, explain experiment of chromatography.	ht	cooking	1	The digestive system is the body's first line of defense.

Chromatography can be thought of as the culinary process of making a sauce. The ingredients (e.g. tomatoes, onions, herbs) are mixed together and then heated in order to create a delicious sauce. However, if you were to try and separate the individual ingredients by simply looking at the sauce, it would be very difficult (if not impossible). This is because they are all mixed together and have essentially become one entity.However, if you were to place the sauce into a container with small holes in the bottom, then pour a solvent (e.g. water) over top, the different ingredients would start to dissolve at different rates. This is because some components will mix more readily with certain solvents than others. As each ingredient dissolves at its own rate, it will travel up through the container at a different speed. In this way, you can effectively "separate" the ingredients of the sauce by using chromatography!	experiment of chromatography	Using a cooking analogy, explain experiment of chromatography.	ht	cooking	1	The digestive system is the body's first line of defense.

Cooking analogy for chromatography: think of components of a mixture as ingredients in a recipe.

In a cooking analogy, think of chromatography as being similar to separating egg whites from yolks. The white and the yolk are both present in the raw egg, but they will separate once they are cooked. This is because the white is mostly water, while the yolk is mostly fat. In chromatography, the solvents work in a similar way. Some substances will dissolve more easily than others, causing them to move faster up the column or paper. This allows them to be separated from each other.	experiment of chromatography	Using a cooking analogy, explain experiment of chromatography.	ht	cooking	1	Bacteria are like tiny little invaders that can get into your food and make you sick.

In cooking, a sauce is often made by combining different ingredients and then simmering them together. Over time, the flavors of the individual ingredients will blend together to create a new flavor. Chromatography works in a similar way. A mixture of different substances is placed on a strip of paper or in a column, and then a solvent is applied. The solvent will travel up the paper or column, dissolving any substances it comes into contact with. As different substances are dissolved to different degrees, they will travel at different speeds, allowing them to be separated from each other. This can be used to determine the composition of mixtures, as well as map out the pathways that molecules take when traveling through cells.	experiment of chromatography	Using a cooking analogy, explain experiment of chromatography.	ht	cooking	1	Bacteria are like tiny little invaders that can get into your food and make you sick.

Like a stove, the main sequence of stars is fueled by hydrogen. More massive stars burn through their fuel more quickly and have shorter lifetimes than less massive stars.

Just as different types of food cook at different rates, stars with different masses evolve at different rates. The more massive a star is, the more hydrogen it consumes per second, and so it exhausts its fuel more quickly. Stars on the main sequence have stable lifetimes because they are balancing the force of gravity that is trying to collapse them against the outward pressure of their own energy. As a star's supply of hydrogen fuel diminishes, it eventually can no longer generate enough energy to resist gravity, and it collapses into a red giant.	main-sequence lifetimes of stars	Using a cooking analogy, explain main-sequence lifetimes of stars.	ht	cooking	1	Bacteria are like tiny little invaders that can get into your food and make you sick.

Stars, like all other forms of life, need food to survive. The amount and type of food that a star needs depends on its size. Small stars can live for a long time by eating simple things like vegetables, while large stars need more complicated foods, such as meat. The main sequence is the period in a star's life when it is eating mostly vegetables (hydrogen). Once it has eaten all the hydrogen in its core, the star moves on to the red giant stage, where it starts eating meat (helium). Red giants have much shorter lifetimes than main-sequence stars because they are consuming more complicated foods.	main-sequence lifetimes of stars	Using a cooking analogy, explain main-sequence lifetimes of stars.	ht	cooking	0	Action potential is the neuron's electrical signal.

A star will spend most of its life on the main sequence. This is because the nuclear fusion reactions that take place in a star's core are stable and provide a reliable source of energy. The main-sequence lifetime of a star depends on its mass; the more massive a star, the shorter its main-sequence lifetime.Smaller stars use up their fuel faster than larger stars, so they exhaust their hydrogen fuel and move off the main sequence sooner. In contrast, larger stars can burn for billions of years before running out of fuel.	main-sequence lifetimes of stars	Using a cooking analogy, explain main-sequence lifetimes of stars.	ht	cooking	1	Action potential is the neuron's electrical signal.

For example, if your sauce is simmering slowly on the stove, turning up the heat will speed it up. Likewise, if you are waiting for your cookies to bake, putting them in a hotter oven will make them cook faster.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Using a cooking analogy, explain rate-determining step of a reaction.	ht	cooking	1	Cooking an egg is a process that uses enzymes to change the chemical composition of the raw egg.

Column chromatography is a lot like making soup. In order to make a good soup, you need different ingredients with different flavors and textures. You start by putting the vegetables into the pot, then you add the broth, and finally you add the meat. The vegetables will cook in the broth and will become softer. The meat will cook in the broth too, but it will remain tougher than the vegetables. By separating the ingredients in this way, you can create a well-cooked soup with all of its individual flavors intact.The same idea applies to column chromatography. In order to separate different compounds in a mixture, you need to use a solvent that has different properties for each compound. The solvent will flow through the column at different speeds, based on these different properties. This separation will allow each compound to be collected at a specific point along the column, creating a purified sample of each compound.	column chromatography	Using a cooking analogy, explain column chromatography.	ht	cooking	1	The rate-determining step of a reaction is the slowest step in the reaction.

The EEG can be thought of as measuring the electrical current running through a brain like you would measure the current running through a wire with a multimeter.

Just as a recipe tells you what ingredients to use and how to put them together, the genetic code in DNA specifies the order of amino acids that make up a protein. The sequence of codons is read one at a time, and each codon corresponds to an amino acid. During protein translation, tRNAs bring the correct amino acids to the ribosome, where they are linked together to create a protein chain.	protein translation	Using a cooking analogy, explain protein translation.	ht	cooking	1	An electroencephalogram, or EEG, is a reading of the electrical activity in your brain.

The process of protein translation can be thought of as cooking a dish from a recipe. In DNA, the code for a particular protein is like the written recipe for that dish. The codons in DNA are like individual instructions in the recipe, telling the ribosome which amino acids to use and how to put them together.

Cooking a dish can be thought of as protein translation. The recipe for the dish is the gene, and the individual ingredients are the codons.

When an action potential reaches a certain point on the neuron, it causes the release of neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic gap and bind to receptors on the next neuron. This triggers another action potential in that neuron.

If you think about a neuron as a long, skinny wire, and the action potential as an electrical current, it's easy to see how the current would travel down the wire. The same thing happens with a neuron - once the action potential reaches a certain point, it causes neurotransmitters to be released. These neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic gap and bind to receptors on the next neuron.

When light hits a surface, some of the energy is absorbed and some is scattered. The amount of scattering depends on the wavelength of the light and the nature of the surface. Anti-stokes scattering occurs when a photon scatters in such a way that its energy is increased. This usually happens when a photon interacts with an atom or molecule that has been excited by another photon.To use a cooking analogy, anti-stokes scattering can be thought of as happening when one microwave cooks something so quickly that it causes sparks (energy increases).	anti-stokes scattering	Using a cooking analogy, explain anti-stokes scattering.	ht	cooking	1	A sound card, also known as an audio card, is a computer hardware component that allows computers to produce and manipulate sounds.

Anti-stokes scattering is a bit like when two different types of foods, one hot and one cold, collide. The hot food will work to heat up the cold food, and vice versa. In anti-stokes scattering, a photon with high energy will interact with an atom or molecule that has been excited by another photon, causing it to absorb more energy and release it in a different direction. This process can continue until all of the energy from the original photon is released.	anti-stokes scattering	Using a cooking analogy, explain anti-stokes scattering.	ht	cooking	1	A sound card, also known as an audio card, is a computer hardware component that allows computers to produce and manipulate sounds.

Anti-stokes scattering occurs when a photon scatters in such a way that its energy is increased. This usually happens when a photon interacts with an atom or molecule that has been excited by another photon.This can be explained using a cooking analogy. When you cook something, it absorbs heat from the oven (or stovetop). If you then turn off the oven or stovetop, the food continues to emit heat for awhile afterwards. This is because the atoms and molecules in the food have been excited by the heat and are now emitting photons (light). These photons are called "anti-Stokes photons" because their energy is increased as a result of scattering.	anti-stokes scattering	Using a cooking analogy, explain anti-stokes scattering.	ht	cooking	1	Glycolysis is the process of breaking down glucose into pyruvate.

Anti-stokes scattering occurs when a photon scatters in such a way that its energy is increased. This usually happens when a photon interacts with an atom or molecule that has been excited by another photon.Using a cooking analogy, anti-stokes scattering can be explained as follows: imagine you are boiling water on the stovetop. When you first turn on the burner, the water starts to heat up quickly. However, if you continue to increase the heat, eventually there will come a point at which adding more heat does not make the water boil any faster - in fact it may even start to boil slower! This phenomenon is known as "thermal saturation."Similarly, when light hits certain materials (like metals), it can cause atoms within those materials to become "excited." Once an atom becomes excited, it will then emit photons (light) of its own - this process is called "stimulated emission." Some of these emitted photons will have more energy than others, and some will be able to excite other atoms in turn. Anti-stokes scattering refers to those situations where one of these high-energy photons causes an atom to become excited and then emits another photon that has even more energy - thus increasing overall energy levels.	anti-stokes scattering	Using a cooking analogy, explain anti-stokes scattering.	ht	cooking	1	Glycolysis is the process of breaking down glucose into pyruvate.

If you are cooking a pot of soup, at some point the soup will reach a state in which the concentrations of all reactants and products are constant. This means that the forward reaction (the reaction that produces soup) and the reverse reaction (the reaction that destroys soup) occur at the same rate, so there is no net change in the concentration of any species.	chemical equilibrium	Using a cooking analogy, explain chemical equilibrium.	ht	cooking	1	A thermostat is a device used to regulate the temperature of an environment.

A pot of boiling water is an example of a chemical equilibrium. The water is at a constant temperature because the forward and reverse reactions (the boiling and cooling of the water) are occurring at the same rate. If you were to take out a spoonful of hot water, it would be replaced by cold water from the sink almost immediately, so the concentration of hot water in the pot remains constant.	chemical equilibrium	Using a cooking analogy, explain chemical equilibrium.	ht	cooking	1	A thermostat is a device that controls the temperature of a room or building.

When a pot of soup is brought to a boil, the concentration of water molecules in the pot increases as they vaporize. At the same time, the concentration of salt molecules decreases as they dissolve in the boiling water. The equilibrium state is reached when the rate at which water molecules vaporize is equal to the rate at which salt molecules dissolve. This ensures that the concentration of both water and salt molecules remains constant.	chemical equilibrium	Using a cooking analogy, explain chemical equilibrium.	ht	cooking	1	A thermostat is a device that controls the temperature of a room or building.

Chemical equilibrium is like a pot of water on the stove. If you turn the heat up, the water boils and the molecules in the liquid start moving around faster. If you turn the heat down, eventually the water will cool off and reach equilibrium where there is no change in temperature even though the burner is still on. In a pot of boiling water, some molecules are turning into gas (the forward reaction) while others are turning back into liquid (the reverse reaction). At equilibrium, these rates are equal and so there is no net change in temperature.	chemical equilibrium	Using a cooking analogy, explain chemical equilibrium.	ht	cooking	1	A thermostat is a device that controls the temperature of a room or building.

A skillet on the stove is an analogy for chemical equilibrium. The forward reaction is the heat from the stovetop cooking the food.

If you have a pan of water on the stove and want to increase the heat, you would turn up the burner. This in turn increases the temperature of the water.

Just as with cooking, if you want to make your food cook faster, you turn up the heat; if you want to reduce the amount of power it takes to achieve a certain level of heating, you use a thinner gauge wire. With electricity it's exactly the same - if you want more current flowing through a circuit, increase the voltage; if you want less current flowing through a circuit but don't want to change the voltage, decrease the resistance.	ohm's law	Using a cooking analogy, explain ohm's law.	ht	cooking	1	Chemical equilibrium is a situation in which the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal, so that the concentrations of the reactants and products do not change with time.
Imagine there is a pot of water on the stove, and you want to increase the temperature. One way to do this is by turning up the heat. The higher the heat setting, the faster the water will boil. This analogy can be used to explain ohm's law. If you have a 100-watt lightbulb in a room and you want to make it brighter, you could either replace the lightbulb with one that has a higher wattage or turn up the voltage going into it.

If you have a stove with two knobs, one for the oven and one for the burner, think of voltage as being like the heat setting on the oven knob. The higher the voltage (heat setting), the more current will flow through the circuit. Current is analogous to how much gas flows out of the burner knob when it's turned on. The greater the current, the brighter or hotter things will get in your electrical circuit. Resistance can be thought of as being like how tight or loose your grip is on either knob.

When light shines on a leaf, some of the light is reflected off the surface of the leaf. This reflected light travels in a straight line back to our eyes. However, some of the light is also absorbed by the leaf. This absorbed light is converted into heat, and it is the heat that causes the leaf to vibrate. These vibrations cause the light that was absorbed to be scattered in all directions. This is why leaves appear to be green; the scattered light combines with the reflected light to create the color we see.Anti-Stokes scattering is a type of scattering that occurs when light is scattered in the opposite direction of the incident light. In other words, it is the scattering of light that occurs when the light is traveling in the opposite direction of the object that is absorbing the light. This type of scattering is very rare, and it is only seen when the light is traveling through a medium that is very dense, such as a diamond.	anti-stokes scattering	Explain anti-stokes scattering using a gardening analogy.	lt	gardening	1	An activator protein is a type of protein that helps to get other proteins working.

Analog audio cards use a circuit to convert an electronic signal into an acoustic one, while digital audio cards use a codec to encode and decode an electronic signal into binary form so that it can be manipulated by a computer.To explain this using a gardening analogy, imagine you are trying to water your flowers using two different methods: One is by directly pouring water from the faucet onto the plants, while the other method uses a watering can. The first method would be analogous to using an analog audio card, as you are sending a direct stream of water straight onto the plants. The second method would be analogous to using a digital audio card, as you are filling up the watering can with water and then slowly releasing it over time in order to provide adequate hydration for the plants.	audio card	Explain audio card using a gardening analogy.	ht	gardening	1	Ram is a gardening term for the male part of a flower.

When light shines on a leaf, some of the light is reflected directly back to our eyes. This is called specular reflection and it’s what makes leaves look shiny. But most of the light shining on a leaf scatters in all directions. Some of this scattered light reaches our eyes directly, while some bounces off other objects before reaching us. This type of scattering is called diffuse reflection.An analogy for stokes scattering could be imagining that when sunlight hits a raindrop, it behaves like billions upon billions of tiny mirrors reflecting sunlight in every direction.	stokes scattering	Explain stokes scattering using a gardening analogy.	ht	gardening	1	Ram is a gardening term for the male part of a flower.

Direct sunlight will often reflect off hard surfaces such as paving stones or walls in a bright, concentrated beam. However, as the sun shines down on plants and flowers in the garden, its rays are dispersed by the many surfaces they encounter – petals, leaves, stems and soil. The result is that gardens are generally much brighter than paved areas (even on cloudy days), because so much more diffuse light is being emitted from all these different angles	stokes scattering	Explain stokes scattering using a gardening analogy.	ht	gardening	1	Ram is a gardening term for the male part of a flower.

With specular reflection, the light reflects off the surface in a mirror-like fashion, traveling in one specific direction. When you see someone's face reflecting off a pool of water, that's an example of specular reflection. Diffuse reflection occurs when the light scatters in many different directions after hitting the surface; this is what happens when you see someone's face illuminated by headlights from behind them at night.	stokes scattering	Explain stokes scattering using a gardening analogy.	ht	gardening	1	A mouse is a small rodent that lives in the garden.

If you've ever tried to water a succulent, you know that it's not as easy as just spraying the plant with H2O. That's because succulents have evolved to contain hydrophobic chemicals in their tissues that repel water. These plants store water in their leaves and stems, so they don't need to rely on groundwater or rainfall to stay hydrated. By clustering together, these chemicals create small pockets within the tissue that make it more difficult for water to move through the plant.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect using a gardening analogy.	ht	gardening	1	A mouse is a small rodent that lives in the garden.

If you've ever tried to water a hydrophobic plant, you know how frustrating it can be. The water simply beads up and rolls off the leaves, never making it past the chemical barriers. Even if you manage to get some liquid into the soil, it won't be able to travel far enough to reach the roots. This is because the hydrophobic chemicals are repelling each other and preventing the water from passing through.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect using a gardening analogy.	ht	gardening	1	A mouse is a small rodent that lives in the garden.

Imagine a garden with two types of plants: those that love water (hydrophilic) and those that hate it (hydrophobic). The plants that love water will grow big and healthy, because they'll soak up all the water they can get their roots on. The plants that hate water will struggle to survive, since they don't like being around all that H2O. The hydrophobic chemicals in these plants will cluster together in small pockets within the plant, making it harder for water to move through the tissue.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect using a gardening analogy.	ht	gardening	1	A mouse is a small rodent that lives in the garden.

Just like with hydrophobic chemicals, water is also attracted to other water molecules and will naturally flow towards them. This is why it's so easy for us to get dehydrated. Plants rely on water to transport nutrients up their stems and distribute them throughout their leaves, but hydrophobic chemicals don't like being around all that H2O. So they cluster together in small pockets within the plant, making it harder for water to move through the tissue.

A star's main sequence lifetime can be thought of as the length of time it spends growing flowers. During its main sequence lifetime, a star steadily burns hydrogen to create light and heat. This process is relatively stable, so stars will remain on the main sequence for billions of years. Once a star's hydrogen supply is exhausted, it will enter into a more unstable phase where it begins to burn helium. This process causes the star to swell and become a red giant. Eventually, the star will exhaust its helium supply and collapse down to form a white dwarf.	main-sequence lifetimes of stars	Using a gardening analogy, explain main-sequence lifetimes of stars.	ht	gardening	1	Lymphocytes are the cells of the immune system that originate in the bone marrow and circulate in the blood.

A star's main sequence lifetime is like the life of a plant. A plant will start off as a seed, grow into a young plant, and then eventually reach adulthood. During its adult years, the plant will continue to grow but remain stable. However, once the plant reaches the end of its lifespan it will die and decompose. This analogy can be applied to stars because they too have an early childhood (main sequence), an adult phase where they remain stable, and a death phase where they collapse down into white dwarfs.	main-sequence lifetimes of stars	Using a gardening analogy, explain main-sequence lifetimes of stars.	ht	gardening	1	Lymphocytes are the cells of the immune system that originate in the bone marrow and circulate in the blood.

However, eventually the tree will stop growing and start to decline. It will lose its leaves and branches, until it is nothing more than a skeleton. In much the same way, stars spend most of their lives in a stable phase known as the main sequence. But once they run out of hydrogen fuel, they begin to enter into an unstable phase where they burn helium. This causes them to swell up and become red giants.

A star's lifetime is determined by its mass. The higher the mass, the shorter the lifetime. A star in the main sequence has enough fuel to undergo fusion reactions for a long time. A low-mass star like our sun will fuse hydrogen into helium for about 10 billion years. As it fuses more and more hydrogen, its core gets hotter and denser. When the core becomes hot enough, helium starts to fuse into carbon. This increases the pressure and temperature in the core until hydrogen begins to fuse again.

In a garden, the different plants are specialized to do different things - some grow tall and produce flowers, others grow small and produce vegetables. The plants in the garden communicate with each other by sending chemical messages (hormones) to each other, telling them when to germinate, when to flower, and when to die. In the same way, cells in our bodies specialize to do different things (such as producing energy or controlling movement) and they communicate with each other by sending chemical messages (hormones) telling them what to do.	specialization and communication in a cell	Using a gardening analogy, explain specialization and communication in a cell.	ht	gardening	1	Chromosomes are the building blocks of DNA.

One way to think about the specialization and communication within cells is by analogy to gardening. In a garden, plants may specialize in different tasks such as bearing fruit, providing flowers, or growing leaves. Plants also communicate with each other by releasing chemicals into the air or soil that can be sensed by other plants. These chemical messages tell the plants how close they are to one another, how much light is available, what kind of nutrients are present in the soil, and when it's time for them to flower.

Kirchhoff's voltage law can be explained using the analogy of a garden hose. If you have one end of the hose attached to a faucet and the other end in a puddle, water will flow from the faucet to the puddle until they are at equal pressure. This is because Nature seeks equilibrium - in this case, between high and low pressure points. The same principle applies to an electrical circuit: if you have a battery (high pressure) connected to a light bulb (low pressure), current will flow until both voltages are equal.	kirchoff's voltage law	Using a gardening analogy, explain kirchoff's voltage law.	ht	gardening	1	Cytosol is the liquid in plant cells that fills the cell cavity and surrounds the organelles.

If you have a series circuit of three batteries (voltage sources), and measure the voltage at point A, it should be equal to the voltage at point B plus the voltage at point C. This is like having three garden hoses hooked together in a loop - water flows from one hose to another until it reaches equilibrium, with the same amount of water flowing into each hose.

These organelles are sort of like miniature gardens, where proteins are assembled according to the instructions contained in an mRNA molecule.	protein translation	Using a gardening analogy, explain protein translation.	ht	gardening	1	RNA transcription is the process of copying genetic information from DNA to RNA. This process begins when an enzyme called RNA polymerase binds to a specific site on the DNA molecule. The enzyme then starts to copy the gene, creating a new strand of RNA.
The process of making a protein can be thought of as planting a garden. The instructions for the garden are written down in a set of instructions, called DNA. These instructions are like a recipe that tells the ribosomes what kind of protein to make and how to put it together. Just as you would need different types of seeds to plant a garden with many different kinds of plants, the ribosome needs different genetic codes (or codons) to create all the various proteins in our cells.	protein translation	Using a gardening analogy, explain protein translation.	ht	gardening	1	RNA transcription is the process of copying genetic information from DNA to RNA.

In prokaryotes, the process of protein translation takes place in the cytoplasm, which can be thought of as the soil. The mRNA is like a seed that contains the instructions for assembling a particular protein molecule. The ribosomes are like gardeners who read the instructions on the seed and use them to put together the amino acids needed to create the desired protein.	protein translation	Using a gardening analogy, explain protein translation.	ht	gardening	1	In translation, the genetic code in DNA is converted into proteins. The process begins with an mRNA molecule being formed from a gene on the DNA. This mRNA molecule then leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm of the cell, where it is read by ribosomes. Ribosomes are tiny structures made up of protein and RNA that act as machines to translate the genetic code into proteins. They do this by reading codons, which are sequences of three nucleotides in DNA that correspond to amino acids. For each codon, there is a specific tRNA molecule that recognizes it and brings the corresponding amino acid to attach to the chain being built. When all of the codons have been translated, you end up with a completed protein chain.
Translation is essentially the process of putting together a complex molecule (in this case, a protein) from simple components (amino acids). The sequence of codons in an mRNA molecule provides instructions for assembling the amino acids into the desired protein. Just as with any other kind of assembly project, there needs to be someone giving instructions (the mRNA), some workers who are doing the actual construction work (the amino acids), and appropriate tools and supplies (enzymes, nitrogenous bases, etc.).	protein translation	Using a gardening analogy, explain protein translation.	ht	gardening	1	In translation, the genetic code in DNA is converted into proteins.

A garden ecosystem is made up of all the plants, animals, and microorganisms in an area and the physical environment in which they live. The plants in a garden provide food and shelter for the animals, who in turn help to pollinate the flowers and spread seeds. The soil provides a home for beneficial microbes that break down organic matter into nutrients that can be used by the plants. In order to create or maintain a healthy garden ecosystem, it is important to consider all of these elements and make sure they are working together harmoniously.	ecosystem	Using a gardening analogy, explain ecosystem.	ht	gardening	1	In translation, the genetic code in DNA is converted into proteins.

A garden ecosystem is made up of all the plants, animals, and microorganisms in an area and the physical environment in which they live. The plants in a garden create shade and shelter for the animals, who eat the plants or other small creatures living there. The insects that feed on the plants pollinate them, and the microbes that live in the soil help to break down dead plant matter so that new growth can occur. In return, the animals provide food for predators such as birds or cats, and disperse seeds throughout the garden as they travel.	ecosystem	Using a gardening analogy, explain ecosystem.	ht	gardening	1	In translation, the genetic code in DNA is converted into proteins.

A garden ecosystem is similar to a natural ecosystem in that it contains all the plants, animals, and microorganisms in an area and the physical environment in which they live. However, a garden ecosystem is man-made and typically smaller than a natural ecosystem. Garden ecosystems can be used to study how different species interact with each other and the environment.	ecosystem	Using a gardening analogy, explain ecosystem.	ht	gardening	1	In translation, the ribosome reads the sequence of codons in a messenger RNA molecule and assembles corresponding amino acids to form a protein. This process is initiated by the binding of a molecule of transfer RNA (tRNA) to a specific site on the mRNA.

A garden ecosystem is made up of all the plants, animals, and microorganisms in an area and the physical environment in which they live. Just as in a natural ecosystem, the health of a garden ecosystem is determined by how well its parts work together. The plants provide food and shelter for the animals, who in turn help to pollinate the plants and control pests. The microorganisms break down dead plant material into nutrients that can be used by other organisms. And the physical environment—the soil, water, temperature, light levels, etc.—provides all the necessary conditions for these living things to thrive	ecosystem	Using a gardening analogy, explain ecosystem.	ht	gardening	1	In translation, the ribosome reads the sequence of codons in a messenger RNA molecule and assembles corresponding amino acids to form a protein.

The propagation of an action potential down a neuron can be thought of as the spreading of an electrical signal from one end of a garden hose to the other. The electrical signal is created by the movement of positively charged ions into and out of the hose. The action potential starts at the faucet (nerve terminal), where it is generated by the release of neurotransmitters. The action potential travels down the hose to the nozzle (axon), where it causes that neuron to fire.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Using a gardening analogy, explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron.	ht	gardening	1	In translation, the ribosome reads the sequence of codons in a messenger RNA molecule and assembles corresponding amino acids to form a protein.

The propagation of an action potential down a neuron can be thought of as the spreading of an electrical signal from one end of a garden hose to the other. Just like charges moving through a wire, the movement of ions creates an electrical current that travels down the neuron.

When you water your garden, the water flows from the hose to the plants. The same thing happens with an action potential: it travels from the nerve terminal to the next neuron.

When a gardener wants to water their plants, they need to turn on the faucet. This sends water flowing down the hose and into each individual plant. In much the same way, when an action potential is generated in a neuron, it causes sodium ions to flow into the neuron. This influx of ions creates an electrical current that travels down the axon and triggers the release of neurotransmitters at its synapses.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Using a gardening analogy, explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron.	ht	gardening	1	Protein translation is the process by which a protein molecule is created from the sequence of codons in an mRNA molecule.

An action potential is a bit like an electrical spark that travels down a wire. It starts at one end of the neuron (the "spark plug") and spreads along the length of the axon (the "wire"). This happens because the voltage-gated sodium channels open up and allow positively charged sodium ions to flow into the neuron. This creates an electrical current that travels down the axon until it reaches the synapses, where it triggers the release of neurotransmitters.	propagation of an action potential down a neuron	Using a gardening analogy, explain propagation of an action potential down a neuron.	ht	gardening	1	Protein translation is the process by which a protein molecule is created from the sequence of codons in an mRNA molecule.

When someone pushes down on a garden hose, the pressure of their hand forces water to flow through the hose. This same principle applies to neurons: when the voltage-gated sodium channels open, they allow positively charged sodium ions to flow into the neuron.

This would give you an estimate for how old the tree is.	tree's age calculation	What is a good analogy to explain tree's age calculation to student who likes gardening?	ht	gardening	0	An activator protein is a type of transcription factor that helps to initiate the process of transcription. It binds to specific DNA sequences in the promoter region of a gene and recruits other proteins, including RNA polymerase, which then begins to transcribe the gene into mRNA.

This occurs because water molecules are polar and they are attracted to the charged regions of the molecule. The nonpolar molecules do not have these charges and so they are repelled by the water. This leads to them clustering together, away from the water.
One way to think of it would be to imagine a tree as a person. Let's say the person is 100 years old. If we divide that number by the number of years they have been alive, we get their age in years: 1 year old.	tree's age calculation	What is a good analogy to explain tree's age calculation to student who likes gardening?	ht	gardening	1	The hydrophobic effect is the tendency of nonpolar molecules to aggregate in an aqueous environment.

Enzymes are like tiny gardeners that help plants grow. They work by speeding up chemical reactions in the plant's cells. This helps the plant to grow faster and stronger. Enzymes do this by attaching themselves to molecules called substrates. The enzymes then break these substrates down into smaller pieces, which makes it easier for the plant to use them as food.	enzymes	Using an analogy, explain enzymes to student who likes gardening.	ht	gardening	0	Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes are like weed killers.

The rate-determining step of a reaction is the slowest step in the reaction. This means that the reaction will not proceed very quickly unless this step is sped up. In gardening, the rate-determining step is planting a seed. Once the seed is planted, water and sunlight are necessary for the plant to grow. The plant will not grow if only one of these requirements is met.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Using an analogy, explain rate-determining step of a reaction to student who likes gardening.	ht	gardening	1	The nucleus of a plant is its most important part.

The plant will not grow if only one of these requirements is met. In chemistry, the rate-determining step is also often the slowest step in a reaction. This means that it determines how fast or slow a reaction occurs. If all other steps in a reaction are sped up except for this slowest step, then the entire reaction will speed up.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Using an analogy, explain rate-determining step of a reaction to student who likes gardening.	ht	gardening	1	The nucleus of a plant is its most important part.

In a chemical reaction, the rate-determining step is the process of converting reactants into products. This step determines how quickly the reaction will take place. If all of the reactants are converted into products, then there will be no more material left to produce more product, and so the reaction stops.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Using an analogy, explain rate-determining step of a reaction to student who likes gardening.	ht	gardening	1	The nucleus of a plant is its most important part.

The rate-determining step of a reaction is the first step in the reaction that determines how fast the entire reaction will take place. This means that if something changes in this first step, it will affect how quickly the whole reaction happens. For example, in gardening, if you plant a seed and do not water it, then it will not grow. In order for the plant to grow, both water and sunlight are necessary. So, just like with gardening, if something is missing in the first step of a chemical reaction, then the reaction won't happen at all or it will happen very slowly.	rate-determining step of a reaction	Using an analogy, explain rate-determining step of a reaction to student who likes gardening.	ht	gardening	1	Enzymes are like tiny gardeners that help plants grow.

Water molecules are attracted to each other, which is why they form droplets when it rains. This attraction is called the hydrophobic effect. The hydrophobic effect causes nonpolar molecules (like oil) to be drawn together and away from water.

One way to think about the hydrophobic effect is by imagining that water is like a group of people at a party. The people are all chatting and having a good time, but then someone in the group pulls out a cigarette. All of the other people start avoiding that person, creating a space around them. This is similar to what happens with molecules when the hydrophobic effect occurs - the nonpolar molecules are drawn together and away from water.	hydrophobic effect	Using an analogy, explain hydrophobic effect to student who likes gardening.	ht	gardening	1	A thermostat is a device that helps maintain a desired temperature in a room or other space.

There are two parts of the immune system: innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is your first line of defense.

But if you are standing on the other side of the room, you will hear the sound coming from where the drummer is standing. This is because when something emits sound (like when someone hits a drum), it pushes air particles away from itself in all directions. The air particles carry the sound with them as they move.

When light waves bounce off of a surface, they can be scattered in the same direction as the light beam or in other directions. When scattering occurs in the same direction as the light beam, it is called forward scattering. When scattering occurs in other directions, it is called backward scattering or anti-stokes scattering. Backward scattering happens when photons scatter off of an object and head in the opposite direction of where the original light was coming from. This type of scattering usually happens with larger objects that have a lot of surface area. Anti-stokes scattering is very rare and occurs when photons scatter off of an object and head back in the direction from which they originally came.	anti-stokes scattering	Using an analogy, explain anti-stokes scattering to student who likes music.	ht	music	0	A mouse is a small, rodent-like creature that is often used as a symbol for computing.

When scattering occurs in the same direction as the light beam, it is called forward scattering.

Anti-stokes scattering is like when a person stands behind the singer at a concert and claps their hands. The sound waves from the singer's voice are travelling towards the audience, and the sound waves from the clapping hands are travelling in the opposite direction (away from the audience). This causes some of the sound waves to be reflected back towards the stage, which amplifies the singer's voice.	anti-stokes scattering	Using an analogy, explain anti-stokes scattering to student who likes music.	ht	music	1	A mouse is a small rodent that is closely related to the rat.

If you think of light waves as being like sound waves, then scattering is a bit like echoes. When sound waves pass through a medium, they interact with the molecules in that medium. Some of the energy from the sound wave is transferred to the molecule and then bounces off in a new direction. This process is called scattering. The amount of scattering depends on how big the molecule is and how close it is to the sound wave. Small molecules scatter sound more than large ones because they have more surface area per unit volume. Scattering also increases as the distance between the molecule and the sound wave decreases.	stokes scattering	Using an analogy, explain stokes scattering to student who likes music.	ht	music	1	A mouse is a small rodent that is closely related to the rat.

Kirchhoff's Voltage Law is similar to the way that a basketball team must keep track of the total point differential in order to stay ahead or behind their opponents. If one player on the basketball team scores 5 points, and then their opponent scores 6 points, the team must add those two numbers together (5+6=11) in order to know how much they are behind. In electrical circuits, this law means that you have to keep track of all the voltages in order to make sure that they add up to zero.

If you are playing a game of baseball, and you have to get from first base to third base, you can't just hopscotch your way there. You have to take the most direct path, running from first to second to third. The same is true for electrical circuits-you can't take a shortcut through an resistor. You have to go straight from one point to another. So if you have three resistors in a row (R1, R2, and R3), and the voltage at point A is 10 volts, the voltage at point B is 5 volts, and the voltage at point C is 0 volts, then the voltage at point D (point C plus the sum of voltages across R1 and R2) would be 5 + (10 - 5) = 10 volts.	kirchoff's voltage law	Using a sports analogy, explain kirchoff's voltage law.	ht	sport	1	In a cell, specialization refers to the different parts of the cell that have specific functions.

However, if you watch the ball carefully, you will see that it never really stops moving; it just changes direction as it bounces off of each person's hand. In a similar way, particles in a wave mechanical model never stop moving; they just change direction when they interact with other particles.	wave mechanical model	Using a sports analogy, explain wave mechanical model.	ht	sport	1	If software is brittle, it means that it breaks or fails easily.

Just-in-time is like a basketball team that only has five players on the court at a time. When one player gets tired, they rotate out and another player comes in. This approach keeps the team fresh and prevents them from wasting energy by playing too long. In the same way, just-in-time ensures that you're not wasting time or money by having unnecessary inventory on hand. When a new order comes in, the necessary components are pulled from stock and assembled into the finished product.	just-in-time	Using a sports analogy, explain just-in-time.	ht	sport	1	A thermostat is a device that regulates the temperature of a system.

Athletes often use just-in-time training to optimize their performance. This technique involves using only the necessary equipment and drills during practice, so that players are not wasting energy or time on things that won't help them in the game. Just-in-time can also be used in business to reduce waste and improve quality.

It would be like a quarterback calling an audible at the line of scrimmage. The offense has a plan, but the quarterback sees something on the defense that leads him to believe he can get a better matchup by changing the play. In just-in-time manufacturing, you're always adjusting your production schedule based on incoming orders. If demand increases, you'll produce more units. If demand decreases, you'll reduce your output.	just-in-time	Using a sports analogy, explain just-in-time.	ht	sport	1	In chemical equilibrium, the concentrations of reactants and products are equal.

In basketball, just-in-time would be when the player has just enough time to catch the ball and make a shot. There is no wasted motion or energy, and everything is done in a quick and efficient manner. This is what manufacturers strive for in their production process - to have just enough components on hand so that they're not wasting time or money by storing inventory. When a new order comes in, the necessary components are pulled from stock and assembled into the finished product. This approach minimizes the amount of work-in-process (WIP), which reduces the risk of defects and makes it easier to track inventory levels.	just-in-time	Using a sports analogy, explain just-in-time.	ht	sport	1	In chemical equilibrium, the concentrations of reactants and products are equal. This occurs because the rate of the reaction is equal to the rate of diffusion.
If you have ever played a sport, you know that there is a basic principle that governs how the game is played. Ohm's law is like this basic principle in electrical engineering. Just as athletes must obey the laws of physics to play their sport correctly, engineers must obey the laws of electricity (including ohm's law) to design and build electrical circuits correctly.	ohm's law	Using a sports analogy, explain ohm's law.	ht	sport	1	In chemical equilibrium, the concentrations of reactants and products are equal. This occurs because the rate of the reaction is equal to the rate of diffusion.
If you think of voltage as being represented by water pressure, and resistance as being a narrowing in the pipe, then Ohm's Law is simply saying that the more pressure (voltage) you have behind the water (current), the faster it will flow through the restricted area (resistance).	ohm's law	Using a sports analogy, explain ohm's law.	ht	sport	1	In chemical equilibrium, the concentrations of reactants and products are equal. This occurs because the rate of the reaction is equal to the rate of diffusion.
Ohm's law is like the relationship between velocity and distance in a race. The greater the difference in voltage (the faster runner), the more current will flow through the conductor (the faster runner). Just as with runners, though, there is always a limit to how much current can flow, based on the resistance of the material.	ohm's law	Using a sports analogy, explain ohm's law.	ht	sport	1	In chemical equilibrium, the concentrations of reactants and products are equal. This occurs because the rate of the reaction is equal to the rate of diffusion.
If you think of a circuit as being like a water pipe, current would be the flow of water (in gallons per minute), voltage would be the difference in water pressure between two points in the pipe (in pounds per square inch or p.s.i.), and resistance would be the thickness of the pipe walls (in inches). Just as with water flowing through a pipe, electric current will flow more easily through some materials than others. The thicker the material's walls are, the greater the resistance will be to electric current passing through it. So if you have a high-voltage source with low-resistance wire leading to it, and then plug something into that wire with high-resistance plugs, there is going to be less current flowing through that device than if you had used lower-resistance plugs.	ohm's law	Using a sports analogy, explain ohm's law.	ht	sport	1	Chemical equilibrium is the state in which the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal. This means that there is no net change in the concentration of any reactants or products.
If you think of voltage as being the pressure and current as the flow rate, then Ohm's Law is saying that the two are proportional. In other words, if you increase the pressure (voltage), then you'll also see an increase in the flow rate (current). Conversely, if you decrease the pressure, then you'll also see a decrease in the flow rate.	ohm's law	Using a sports analogy, explain ohm's law.	ht	sport	1	Chemical equilibrium is the state in which the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal.

In genetic transcription, individual genes are copied from DNA to a molecule called RNA. This process is important because it allows cells to produce proteins based on the instructions contained within genes. In a way, you could think of transcription as the first step in protein synthesis. Just like athletes need to practice in order to improve their skills, cells must transcribe genes in order to create proteins.	transcription	Using a sports analogy, explain transcription.	ht	sport	1	Chemical equilibrium is the state in which the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal.

Transcription is like a coach taking game footage and turning it into a highlight reel. The coach takes the footage of the game (the genetic information) and copies it to a new medium (RNA). This allows them to create a video that shows only the best moments of the game. Transcription does something similar in cells - it copies the genetic information from DNA to RNA, allowing proteins to be created based on that information.	transcription	Using a sports analogy, explain transcription.	ht	sport	1	Chemical equilibrium is the state in which the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal.

Transcription is a bit like when you are at a sports game and the announcer is talking. The announcer is talking on a microphone, and the sounds that come out of the microphone are being copied (transcribed) onto a piece of paper. In the same way, when genetic information is transcribed from DNA to RNA, it's as if someone was writing down what was being said in the nucleus of cells. This process happens all the time inside our bodies and is responsible for creating proteins - which are essential for life!	transcription	Using a sports analogy, explain transcription.	ht	sport	1	Just-in-time is a manufacturing strategy that strives to improve quality and decrease waste.

Transcription is like a quarterback in football. The quarterback receives the play from the coach and then repeats it to the rest of the players on the field.

Water molecules are attracted to each other by hydrogen bonds. Hydrophobic (water-hating) molecules do not have any exposed polar groups and therefore cannot form hydrogen bonds with other water molecules. These hydrophobic molecules tend to clump together in an aqueous environment because there is nothing to prevent them from doing so.

The hydrophobic molecules are like the other team - they can't score any points (or in this analogy, they can't get close to the water molecules).

In an aqueous environment, these water molecules will orient themselves so that the hydrogen bond is between the oxygen atom of one molecule and the nitrogen atom of another molecule. This creates a network of hydrogen bonds that makes up the bulk of liquid water. Hydrophobic (water-hating) molecules do not have any exposed polar groups and therefore cannot form hydrogen bonds with other water molecules. These hydrophobic molecules tend to clump together in an aqueous environment because there is nothing to prevent them from doing so.

Glycolysis provides this energy by breaking down the sugar into molecules that can be used by the muscles right away.	glycolysis	Using an analogy, explain glycolysis to student who likes sports.	ht	sport	1	A mouse is a small rodent that is commonly used as a pet.

When a wave encounters an obstacle, part of the wave is reflected off the obstacle and part is transmitted through it. If the obstacle is very small compared to the wavelength of the wave, most of the energy will be reflected. This process is called reflection. If the obstacle is large compared to the wavelength, most of the energy will be transmitted. This process is called transmission. When a wave encounters an object that has a different refractive index than its surroundings, some of the energy will be absorbed by	anti-stokes scattering	Using an analogy, explain anti-stokes scattering to student who likes sports.	ht	sport	0	A mouse is a small rodent that is commonly used as a pet.

When a wave encounters an object that has a different refractive index than its surroundings, some of the energy will be absorbed by the object and some will be scattered in all directions. The amount of scattering depends on how big or small the object is compared to the wavelength and on how much difference there is between refractive indices of materials surrounding objects and objects themselves.An analogy for this process could involve two people playing catch. If one person was wearing a heavy coat, they would scatter the ball more than if they were not wearing a coat. This is because their body has a different refractive index than the air around them.	anti-stokes scattering	Using an analogy, explain anti-stokes scattering to student who likes sports.	ht	sport	1	A mouse is a small rodent that is commonly used as a pet.

When a ball is thrown at someone, they may move towards the ball to catch it or away from the ball to dodge it. If they move towards the ball, they are said to be "stoking" it. If they move away from the ball, they are said to be "anti-stroking" it. Anti-Stokes scattering is when light scatters in directions opposite of where it was originally travelling.	anti-stokes scattering	Using an analogy, explain anti-stokes scattering to student who likes sports.	ht	sport	1	A mouse is a small rodent that is commonly used as a pet.

Suppose you are a basketball coach and want to know whether your players are improving. You could compare the average score of your team in each game of the season. If there is no difference between the scores, it might be reasonable to conclude that your team is not getting better. However, if you see that the average score in later games is higher than in earlier ones, then you can say with more confidence that your players are getting better. This type of analysis would be done using anova.	anova	Using an analogy, explain anova to student who likes sports.	ht	sport	1	Glycolysis is the process that breaks down glucose (sugar) in the body to produce energy.

One way to think of an ANOVA is as a tool that allows us to compare the batting averages of different groups of baseball players. In order to do this, we first need to calculate each player's batting average and then create a table that compares the averages for each group. The ANOVA tells us whether or not there is a statistically significant difference between the batting averages of these groups.	anova	Using an analogy, explain anova to student who likes sports.	ht	sport	1	Glycolysis is the process that breaks down glucose (sugar) in the body to produce energy.
