This mechanical energy is converted into an electrical signal by the instrument's pickups, which are analogous to the transduction proteins in cells. The amplifier increases the power of the signal so that it can be heard by the audience. In the same way, the transduction proteins in cells increase the power of the biochemical signals they detect, so that they can be communicated to the rest of the cell.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for student who likes music.
