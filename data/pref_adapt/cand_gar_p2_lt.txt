Adaptive immunity can be thought of as a gardener who plants a variety of flowers and then weeds out the ones that don't grow well. The gardener then plants more of the flowers that grew well and weeds out the ones that didn't. This process is repeated over time, so the gardener has a garden full of flowers that grow well.	adaptive immunity	Explain adaptive immunity using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for student who likes gardening.
Ohm's law is like the water pressure in a garden hose. The water pressure is like the voltage, and the amount of water flowing through the hose is like the current.	ohm's law	Explain ohm's law using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for student who likes gardening.
Transcription is like planting a garden. You put a seed in the ground, water it, and wait for it to grow. The transcription process is similar. You put the DNA molecule into a special machine, add the right chemicals, and wait for the transcription process to occur.	transcription	Explain transcription using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for student who likes gardening.
RNA polymerase is like a gardener who plants seeds in the ground. The gardener waters and fertilizes the ground, and then the seeds grow into plants. RNA polymerase helps to create new strands of RNA by planting nucleotides into a growing strand of RNA. It provides the nutrients (nucleotides) and water that the strand needs to grow.	rna polymerase	Explain rna polymerase using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for student who likes gardening.
Ribosomes are like the gardener who plants the seeds, waters them, and watches them grow. The ribosomes read the instructions in the DNA to create the proteins that the plant needs to grow.	ribosome	Explain ribosome using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for student who likes gardening.
An activator protein is like a gardener who helps plants grow. The activator protein helps the cell's DNA to be read and the cell to grow.	activator protein	Explain activator protein using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for student who likes gardening.
Electricity is like water in a garden hose. The water pressure in the hose can be compared to the voltage in an electric circuit. The amount of water flowing through the hose can be compared to the current in an electric circuit. The hose is like a wire, and the water is like the electricity.	electric circuit	Explain electric circuit using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for student who likes gardening.
Water molecules are attracted to each other by hydrogen bonds. This attraction is called the hydrophilic effect. The hydrophobic effect is the opposite force, which is the attraction of water molecules to nonpolar molecules. This force is weaker than the hydrophilic effect, but it is still important in biology.Think of the hydrophobic effect as the force that attracts water molecules to the soil. The water molecules are attracted to the nonpolar molecules in the soil, and this attraction helps to keep the water in the soil.	hydrophobic effect	Explain hydrophobic effect using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for student who likes gardening.
One way to think of signal transduction is as a process of turning on a garden hose. The faucet is the signal, and the water coming out of the hose is the response. In order to turn on the water, you need to apply pressure to the faucet. The same is true for signal transduction: in order to activate a response, you need to apply a signal.	biological signal transduction	Explain biological signal transduction using an analogy. The analogy should be suitable for student who likes gardening.
