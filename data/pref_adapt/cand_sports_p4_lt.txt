The immune system is constantly learning and adapting to new threats, just like a football team that is always practicing and learning new plays.	adaptive immunity	What is a good analogy to explain adaptive immunity to student who likes sports?
A good analogy to explain Ohm's law to a student who likes sports is to think of electrical current as being like water flowing through a hose. Just as the water pressure in the hose depends on the water's volume and the hose's diameter, the electrical current in a wire depends on the voltage and the wire's resistance.	ohm's law	What is a good analogy to explain ohm's law to student who likes sports?
Transcription is like when a coach explains the game plan to his players. The coach is telling the players what to do on the field and how to do it. The players listen and then go out and play the game. Transcription is the same way. The doctor is telling the patient what to do and how to do it. The patient listens and then goes and does what the doctor says.	transcription	What is a good analogy to explain transcription to student who likes sports?
A good analogy to explain RNA polymerase to a student who likes sports is to compare it to a sports referee. Just as a referee ensures that the game is played fairly and according to the rules, RNA polymerase ensures that the genetic information in DNA is faithfully copied into RNA.	rna polymerase	What is a good analogy to explain rna polymerase to student who likes sports?
A ribosome is like a sports referee. It is responsible for ensuring that the game is played fairly and that the players follow the rules.	ribosome	What is a good analogy to explain ribosome to student who likes sports?
One way to think of activator proteins is as the "coach" of a sports team. Just as a good coach can help a team play to its potential, activator proteins help other proteins do their jobs properly.	activator protein	What is a good analogy to explain activator protein to student who likes sports?
A good analogy to explain electric circuits to a student who likes sports is to compare the flow of electricity to the flow of water in a hose. Just as water flows through a hose when the faucet is turned on, electricity flows through a circuit when the switch is turned on. The current in the circuit is like the water pressure in the hose, and the voltage in the circuit is like the water pressure in the faucet.	electric circuit	What is a good analogy to explain electric circuit to student who likes sports?
Water is like a group of people playing a game of soccer. The water molecules are the people and the soccer ball is the hydrophobic molecule. The water molecules are attracted to each other and the soccer ball is not. This is because the water molecules are polar and the soccer ball is not.	hydrophobic effect	What is a good analogy to explain hydrophobic effect to student who likes sports?
A good analogy to explain biological signal transduction to a student who likes sports is to think of the body as a team of athletes. The athletes are all working together to achieve a common goal. In the body, the cells are the athletes and the goal is to maintain homeostasis. The cells communicate with each other through biological signals, which are like the coach giving instructions to the athletes. The signals tell the cells what to do in order to maintain homeostasis.	biological signal transduction	What is a good analogy to explain biological signal transduction to student who likes sports?
